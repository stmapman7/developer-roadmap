    "title": "MongoDB Basics",
    "description": "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is designed to store and manage large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB employs a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for a dynamic schema, meaning that documents within the same collection can have different structures, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements. MongoDB supports rich query capabilities, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation, enabling developers to perform complex queries efficiently.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "NoSQL and SQL are two distinct paradigms for managing and storing data in databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational and use a structured schema to define data types and relationships, making them ideal for complex queries and transactions. They ensure data integrity and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which are crucial for applications requiring reliable transactions. In contrast, NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer a flexible schema, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Expiring",
    "description": "Expiring indexes (TTL - Time To Live) in MongoDB automatically delete documents from a collection after a specified period, making them ideal for managing time-sensitive data like session information, log entries, temporary caches, or any data that becomes obsolete after a certain duration. These indexes are created on date fields and use a background process that runs every 60 seconds to remove expired documents, helping maintain optimal collection size and performance by preventing the accumulation of outdated data. TTL indexes are particularly useful for applications that generate large volumes of transient data, as they provide an automated cleanup mechanism that reduces storage costs and improves query performance without requiring manual intervention or complex application logic to handle data expiration.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
