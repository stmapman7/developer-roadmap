# Terms of Sale

roadmap.sh is a publication of Insight Media Group, LLC. When you purchase any products or services from Insight Media Group, LLC ("roadmap.sh") through roadmap.sh, you agree to these Terms of Sale ("Terms"). These Terms are incorporated by reference into our Terms of Use, which govern your use of our Website, including any services we make available through the Website. Any capitalized Terms that aren't defined in these Terms are defined in the Terms of Use.

## Pricing

The price of any product or service that you purchase from us, including any courses and subscriptions that we offer, will be made available to you at the time of purchase. From time to time, we may offer discounts (which may be subject to additional terms or requirements, as communicated to you).

Depending on your location, roadmap.sh may be required to collect and remit the applicable sales taxes, goods and services taxes, or value added taxes based on your country or regions consumer sales tax requirements. Any prices that we advertise do not include applicable taxes.

We reserve the right to change the price of products or services at any time.

## Availability of Products and Services

The products or services may be available for a period of time. Where products and services are offered on a limited-time basis (e.g., courses), you will only be able to access the product and service during such period. At the expiration of such period, you will no longer have access to the products and services (and, in the case of courses, regardless of whether or not you completed the course).

## Subscriptions and Renewals

If you purchase products and services on a subscription basis, the subscription will automatically renew (and your payment method will be automatically charged) at the end of the subscription period unless you notify us of cancellation at least 30 days prior to renewal.

## Payments and Payment Methods

By purchasing products and services, you agree to pay all fees associated with your purchase. Full payment must be made at the time of purchase.

You authorize roadmap.sh or its third-party providers, to charge your debit or credit card or to process any other accepted means of payment, for payment of fees, including any renewals. You agree not to provide or use an invalid or unauthorized method of payment. We reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to any course or content for which we have not received the required payment.

## Refunds and Refund Credits (Courses Only)

If for any reason you wish to cancel your purchase of a course, you may request a refund within thirty (30) days of the original purchase date. You may request a refund by submitting a request to info@roadmap.sh. We will not issue refunds if the request is received after the 30-day time limit. Refunds will be prorated based on the date you provide a valid notice of cancellation to us. For example, if you purchase a course for $100 and provide us notice 15 days after the date of purchase, we will issue a refund of 50% or $50. We will apply your refund to your original payment method.

If we determine that you are abusing our refund policy, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict your receipt of future refunds, and/or restrict your access to the use of our Services.

## Modifications and Notice

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Your continued use of the course or other Services, after the effective date of any such change, will be considered acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Incorporation by Reference

These Terms are incorporated by reference into and form part of our Terms of Use. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree that the Terms of Use apply to and govern these Terms.
