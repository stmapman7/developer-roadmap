# EMC and DMS

EMC (Enterprise Metadata Catalog) and DMS (Document Management System) are two distinct concepts in the realm of data management and information systems. Below is an overview of each:

An Enterprise Metadata Catalog (EMC) is a centralized repository that stores metadata about data assets within an organization. This metadata provides context, meaning, and structure to the data, enabling better data management and utilization.

A Document Management System (DMS) is a software solution that helps organizations capture, store, manage, and track electronic documents and images of paper-based information. DMS solutions are essential for organizing and securing documents in a digital format.
