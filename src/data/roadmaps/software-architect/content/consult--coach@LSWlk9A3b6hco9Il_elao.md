# Consult and Coach

Proactive consulting and coaching are essential to prevent architectural issues from escalating. Architects must anticipate future needs and prepare the organization by setting a clear vision of mid- and long-term goals, often using maturity models to provide structure and measure progress against SMART criteria. Building a **Community of Practice (CoP)** fosters collaboration, standardization, and knowledge sharing among professionals with shared interests, such as developers and architects, enhancing individual and organizational growth. Open-door sessions, held regularly without a strict agenda, encourage open communication, resolve minor issues promptly, and address complex topics through follow-ups, reducing misconceptions and ambiguity.
