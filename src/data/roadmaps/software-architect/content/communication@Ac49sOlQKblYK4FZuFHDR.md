# Communication

From my observations this is one of the most underestimated skill. If you are brilliant in design but cannot communicate your ideas, your thoughts are likely to have less impact or even fail to succeed.

Communication is a critical yet often underestimated skill, especially for architects. It involves clearly conveying ideas, structuring discussions effectively, and driving meetings. Tools like “UZMO — Thinking With Your Pen” can enhance visual communication skills. Public speaking, whether to small or large groups, requires practice and stepping out of one’s comfort zone. Tailoring communication to the audience is essential—developers focus on details, while managers prioritize cost and outcomes. Regular, transparent communication ensures alignment across all levels, making the rationale behind decisions clear. Always being prepared with key slides and answers can boost confidence and efficiency during interactions.
