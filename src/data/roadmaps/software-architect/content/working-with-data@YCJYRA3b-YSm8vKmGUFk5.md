# Working with Databases

Working with databases involves storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently to support applications and business processes. Databases can be relational, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, which use structured tables and SQL for querying, or non-relational (NoSQL), like MongoDB and Cassandra, which handle unstructured or semi-structured data. Effective database management requires designing normalized schemas for relational databases, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing queries for performance. For NoSQL databases, it's important to choose the right type (e.g., document, key-value, columnar) based on application needs. Additionally, managing transactions, indexing, backups, and security are crucial for maintaining reliable and scalable database systems.
