# Balance

Achieving balance in architecture requires managing trade-offs between quality, cost, and development speed, avoiding over-engineering while aligning functional and non-functional requirements. Architects must navigate conflicting goals, like balancing short-term simplicity with long-term vision, ensuring solutions fit future needs while involving developers, businesses, and managers in understanding the financial and strategic impact. Additionally, architects often mediate between diverse groups, resolving conflicts and aligning strategies through effective communication, such as the “Four-Ears Model” by Schulze von Thun, which aids in fostering collaboration and achieving balanced, strategic outcomes.
