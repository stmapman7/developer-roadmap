# Server Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) enable servers to send live updates to webpages through one-way HTTP connections. Ideal for live chats, news feeds, and real-time notifications. Clients use EventSource objects to listen for formatted events from server response streams. Simple, browser-compatible solution for real-time updates.
