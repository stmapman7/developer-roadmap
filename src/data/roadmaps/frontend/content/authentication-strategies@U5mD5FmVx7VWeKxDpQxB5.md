# Authentication Strategies

Authentication strategies verify a user's identity to grant access. Common methods include Basic Auth (username/password), Session-based (server remembers login), Token-based (like JWT, a secure digital key), OAuth (for third-party access like "Login with Google"), and SSO (Single Sign-On, one login for many apps). Knowing these helps choose the right security for your app.
