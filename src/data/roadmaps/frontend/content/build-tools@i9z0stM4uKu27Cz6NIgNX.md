# Build Tools

Build tools automate making apps from source code. They compile, link, minify (shrink), and bundle code, run tests, and manage dependencies. Examples are Webpack, Vite, and Parcel for web development. Build tools speed up development, ensure consistency, and optimize code for users. They're key for modern software, especially big projects, making work more efficient and enabling continuous integration (CI).
