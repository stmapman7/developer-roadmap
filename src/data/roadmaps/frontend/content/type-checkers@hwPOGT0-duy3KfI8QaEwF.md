# Type Checkers

Type checkers analyze code for type-related errors before runtime, ensuring correct type usage and catching mistakes early. Examples: TypeScript, Flow (JavaScript), mypy (Python). Add static typing to dynamic languages, improving reliability, readability, and refactoring support for large projects.
