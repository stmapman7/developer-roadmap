# Forums

Support forums are online platforms where developers can ask questions, share solutions, and collaborate on challenges related to specific products, technologies, or tools. They serve as a valuable resource for peer-to-peer support, allowing the community to contribute their expertise, often reducing the workload of official support teams. Active participation by developer advocates in these forums can foster stronger relationships, provide real-time feedback, and build trust within the community by addressing issues, clarifying doubts, and offering guidance in a more interactive and collaborative environment.
