# Code Samples

Code samples are essential in sample projects as they provide concrete, practical examples that help developers understand how to use a platform, library, or tool. Well-crafted code samples should be clear, concise, and focused on demonstrating specific functionality, avoiding unnecessary complexity that might distract from the core concept. They should be easy to read, following consistent naming conventions, proper formatting, and best practices for the relevant programming language. Including inline comments and explanations can help clarify key steps, while additional context in the accompanying documentation or blog post can guide developers through the logic and potential use cases.
