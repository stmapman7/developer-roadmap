# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was first announced by Microsoft in 2015 and quickly became one of the most popular and widely used Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Built on Electron, a framework that allows web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create desktop applications, VSCode offers a lightweight and highly extensible platform for developers. VSCode focuses on being a streamlined code editor with the ability to install extensions that add features such as debugging, version control, and language-specific tooling. Microsoft's vision was to create a flexible environment that could cater to all types of developers, from beginners to seasoned professionals.
