# Code of Conduct

Writing a code of conduct for developer communities involves setting clear guidelines that promote a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all participants. It should define acceptable behavior, outline unacceptable actions (such as harassment, discrimination, or disruptive conduct), and provide examples where necessary to clarify expectations. A well-crafted code of conduct also includes clear procedures for reporting violations, ensuring that community members know how to raise concerns and what they can expect in terms of response. Additionally, it should outline the consequences for breaking the rules, emphasizing that the guidelines are actively enforced to maintain a positive and welcoming community culture. The tone should be firm yet approachable, reflecting the commitment to fairness, safety, and inclusivity.
