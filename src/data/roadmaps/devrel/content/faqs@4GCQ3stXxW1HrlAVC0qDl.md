They help reduce the volume of support tickets by providing quick, accessible answers to recurring problems, ranging from technical troubleshooting to product usage. Well-structured FAQs not only improve customer satisfaction by offering immediate solutions but also free up support teams to focus on more complex cases, ultimately enhancing overall efficiency and user experience.
