# Advocacy

Developer Advocacy is the practice of representing and supporting the needs and interests of developers both within a company and in the broader developer community. Developer Advocates act as liaisons between the companyâ€™s development team and external developers, ensuring that the developers have the tools, resources, and knowledge to effectively use the company's products or platforms. They create educational content, provide technical support, gather feedback, and participate in community events.
