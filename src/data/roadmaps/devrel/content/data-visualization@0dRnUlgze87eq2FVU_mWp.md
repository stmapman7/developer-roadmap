# Data Visualization

Data visualization involves using charts, graphs, and other visual tools to present data clearly and effectively. It transforms raw numbers into visual formats that make patterns, trends, and insights easier to understand at a glance. Good visualizations simplify complex data, highlighting key findings and supporting informed decision-making. When creating these visuals, it’s important to choose the right type—like bar charts for comparisons, line graphs for trends, or pie charts for proportions—and ensure they are clean, accurate, and easy to read.
