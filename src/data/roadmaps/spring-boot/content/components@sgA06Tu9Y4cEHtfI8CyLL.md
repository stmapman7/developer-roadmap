# Components

The Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework has several key components that work together to handle the requests and generate the appropriate responses in a web application.

There are other supporting components that are used to manage the lifecycle of the application's objects, such as the Spring IoC container and different interceptors that provides additional functionality, such as caching and security.
