# Man-in-the-middle attack

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts communication between two parties, such as a user and a website, without their knowledge. The attacker can eavesdrop, alter, or inject false information into the communication, often to steal sensitive data like login credentials or manipulate transactions. MITM attacks are commonly executed through compromised Wi-Fi networks or by exploiting security vulnerabilities in protocols.
