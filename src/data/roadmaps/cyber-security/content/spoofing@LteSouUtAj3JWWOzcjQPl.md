# Spoofing

Spoofing is a form of deception where someone or something pretends to be another person, device, or entity to mislead or gain an advantage. In technology and cybersecurity, it often involves falsifying information like an IP address, email, or website to trick a user or system into believing itâ€™s interacting with a legitimate source. Spoofing can be used to steal sensitive data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt communication.
