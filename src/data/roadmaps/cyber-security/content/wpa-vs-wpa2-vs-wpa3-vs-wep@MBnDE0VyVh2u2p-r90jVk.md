# WPA vs WPA2 vs WPA3 vs WEP

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated and insecure wireless encryption standard that was the first to secure Wi-Fi networks but is now considered highly vulnerable to attacks. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) improved upon WEP with stronger encryption and authentication methods, but it still had some security weaknesses. WPA2, the successor to WPA, introduced more robust encryption with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and improved security overall. WPA3, the latest standard, offers enhanced security features such as stronger encryption, improved protection against brute-force attacks, and better security for public networks. Each successive standard provides increased security and protection for wireless networks.
