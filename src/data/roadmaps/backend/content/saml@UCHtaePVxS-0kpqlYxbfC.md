# Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based framework for single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation. Enables authentication exchange between identity providers (IdP) and service providers (SP) through XML assertions containing user identity and permissions. Streamlines user management and centralized authentication.
