# bind()

The `bind()` method in JavaScript allows you to create a new function with a specific context and optionally preset arguments. Unlike `call()` or `apply()`, `bind()` does not immediately invoke the function. Instead, it returns a new function that can be called later, either as a regular function or with additional arguments. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that a function retains a specific context, regardless of how or when it's invoked.
