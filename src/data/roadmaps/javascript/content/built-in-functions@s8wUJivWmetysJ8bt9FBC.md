# Built in functions

JavaScript offers a variety of built-in functions that simplify common tasks, available globally or within specific objects without requiring explicit definition. Functions like parseInt(), setTimeout(), and Math.random() can be used directly, while objects like Array, String, and Date include built-in methods for efficient data manipulation. Understanding these functions enhances development by leveraging JavaScriptâ€™s core features without reinventing the wheel.
