# String

String is a primitive type that holds a sequence of characters. String in Javascript is written within a pair of single quotation marks `''`, double quotation marks `""`, or backticks ` `` ` (template literals). All types of quotes can be used to contain a string but only if the starting quote is the same as the end quote.
