# boolean

In JavaScript, a `boolean` is a simple data type that can hold one of two values: `true` or `false`. These values are used to represent logical states and are essential in controlling the flow of a program.

Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `while`, etc.) to determine whether a block of code should execute.
