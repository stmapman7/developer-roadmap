# bigint

BigInt is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to work with integers of arbitrary size.

Unlike the Number type, which can accurately represent integers only within the range of Â±2^53 , BigInt can handle integers far beyond this limit. This makes it particularly useful for applications requiring high precision with very large numbers, such as cryptography or scientific computations.
