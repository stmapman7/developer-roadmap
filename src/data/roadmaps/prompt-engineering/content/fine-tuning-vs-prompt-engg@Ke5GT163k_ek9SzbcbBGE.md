# Fine-tuning vs Prompt Engineering

Fine-tuning trains models on specific data to specialize behavior, while prompt engineering achieves customization through input design without model modification. Prompt engineering is faster, cheaper, and more accessible. Fine-tuning offers deeper customization but requires significant resources and expertise.
