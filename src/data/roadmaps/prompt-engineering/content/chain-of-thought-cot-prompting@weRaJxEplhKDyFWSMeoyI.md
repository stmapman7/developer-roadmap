# Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain of Thought prompting improves LLM reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps before providing the final answer. Instead of jumping to conclusions, the model "thinks through" problems step by step. Simply adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts often dramatically improves accuracy on complex reasoning tasks and mathematical problems.
