# Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting provides only a task description without examples, relying on the model's training patterns. Simply describe the task clearly, provide input data, and optionally specify output format. Works well for simple classification, text generation, and Q&A, but may produce inconsistent results for complex tasks.
