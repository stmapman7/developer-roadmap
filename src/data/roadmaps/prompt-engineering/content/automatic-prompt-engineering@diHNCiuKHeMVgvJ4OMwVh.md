# Automatic Prompt Engineering

Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) uses LLMs to generate and optimize prompts automatically, reducing human effort while enhancing model performance. The process involves prompting a model to create multiple prompt variants, evaluating them using metrics like BLEU or ROUGE, then selecting the highest-scoring candidate. For example, generating 10 variants of customer order phrases for chatbot training, then testing and refining the best performers. This iterative approach helps discover effective prompts that humans might not consider, automating the optimization process.
