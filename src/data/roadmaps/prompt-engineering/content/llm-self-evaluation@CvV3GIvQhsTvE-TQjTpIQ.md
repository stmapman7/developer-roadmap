# LLM Self Evaluation

LLM self-evaluation involves prompting models to assess their own outputs for quality, accuracy, or adherence to criteria. This technique can identify errors, rate confidence levels, or check if responses meet specific requirements. Self-evaluation helps improve output quality through iterative refinement and provides valuable feedback for prompt optimization.
