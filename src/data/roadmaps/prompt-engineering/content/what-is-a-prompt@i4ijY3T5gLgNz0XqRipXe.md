# What is a Prompt?

A prompt is an input provided to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response or prediction. It serves as the instruction or context that guides the AI model's output generation process. Effective prompts are clear, specific, well-structured, and goal-oriented, directly affecting the accuracy and relevance of AI responses.
