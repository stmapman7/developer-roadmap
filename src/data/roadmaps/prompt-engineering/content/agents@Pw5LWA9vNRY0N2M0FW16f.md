# Agents

AI agents are autonomous systems that use LLMs to reason, plan, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They combine language understanding with tool usage, memory, and decision-making to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Agents can interact with external APIs and services while maintaining context across interactions.
