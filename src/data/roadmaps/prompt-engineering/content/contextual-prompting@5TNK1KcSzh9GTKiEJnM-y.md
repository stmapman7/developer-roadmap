# Contextual Prompting

Contextual prompting provides specific background information or situational details relevant to the current task, helping LLMs understand nuances and tailor responses accordingly. Unlike system or role prompts, contextual prompts supply immediate, task-specific information that's dynamic and changes based on the situation. For example: "Context: You are writing for a blog about retro 80's arcade video games. Suggest 3 topics to write articles about." This technique ensures responses are relevant, accurate, and appropriately framed for the specific context provided.
