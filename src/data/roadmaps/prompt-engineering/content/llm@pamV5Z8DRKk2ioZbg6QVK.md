# LLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast text data to understand and generate human-like language. They work as prediction engines, analyzing input and predicting the next most likely token. LLMs perform tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and Q&A. Understanding token processing is key to effective prompt engineering.
