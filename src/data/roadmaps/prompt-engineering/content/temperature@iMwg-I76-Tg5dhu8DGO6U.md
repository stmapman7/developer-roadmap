# Temperature

Temperature controls the randomness in token selection during text generation. Lower values (0-0.3) produce deterministic, factual outputs. Medium values (0.5-0.7) balance creativity and coherence. Higher values (0.8-1.0) generate creative, diverse outputs but may be less coherent. Use low temperature for math/facts, high for creative writing.
