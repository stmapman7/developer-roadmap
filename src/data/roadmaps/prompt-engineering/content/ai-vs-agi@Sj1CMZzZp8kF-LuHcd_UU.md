AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems that perform specific tasks intelligently, while AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) represents hypothetical AI with human-level reasoning across all domains. Current LLMs are narrow AI - powerful at language tasks but lacking true understanding or general intelligence like AGI would possess.
