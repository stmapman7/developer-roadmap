# AI Red Teaming

AI red teaming involves deliberately testing AI systems to find vulnerabilities, biases, or harmful behaviors through adversarial prompting. Teams attempt to make models produce undesired outputs, bypass safety measures, or exhibit problematic behaviors. This process helps identify weaknesses and improve AI safety and robustness before deployment.
