# Top-K

Top-K restricts token selection to the K most likely tokens from the probability distribution. Low values (1-10) produce conservative, factual outputs. Medium values (20-50) balance creativity and quality. High values (50+) enable diverse, creative outputs. Use low K for technical tasks, high K for creative writing.
