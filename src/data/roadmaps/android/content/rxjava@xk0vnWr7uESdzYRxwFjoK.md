# RxJava

RxJava, standing for Reactive Extensions for the JVM, is a library in the Java and Android ecosystem that allows developers to write asynchronous, event-based programs. It is developed according to reactive programming principles and it supports multi-threading operations. One can create data streams from just about anything - variables, data structures, inputs, etc. and these streams could be used with functional programming methods to process the data.
