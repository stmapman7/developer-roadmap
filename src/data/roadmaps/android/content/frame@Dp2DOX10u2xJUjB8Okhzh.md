# Frame Layout

**FrameLayout** is a simple ViewGroup subclass in Android that is designed to hold a single child view or a stack of overlapping child views. It positions each child in the top-left corner by default and allows them to overlap on top of each other, which makes it useful for situations where you need to layer views on top of one another.
