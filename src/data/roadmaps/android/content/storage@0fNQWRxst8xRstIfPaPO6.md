# Storage

On Android devices, storage refers to where your data such as apps, photos, videos, and music are saved. It can be categorized into two types: internal and external storage. Internal Storage is where data is stored that's tied directly to your app. This data is private by default and not accessible by other apps. External Storage, on the other hand, is a shared space where all apps can read and write data. It can be further sub-categorized into Public and Private directories. Public directories are shared among all apps while private directories are specific to your app but can be accessed by other apps if they have the appropriate permissions.
