# Interface and Navigation

In Android development, the concepts of "Interface" and "Navigation" are crucial. The "Interface" often refers to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that users interact with. This includes buttons, text fields, image views, scroll views and other UI elements that the users can interact with to perform certain tasks. Tools like XML and Material Designs are used for interface design in Android.
