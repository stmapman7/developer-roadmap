# LinearLayout

**LinearLayout** is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction, vertically or horizontally. You can specify the layout direction with the `android:orientation` attribute.

**LinearLayout** was commonly used in earlier Android development, but with the introduction of ConstraintLayout, itâ€™s less frequently used in modern apps.
