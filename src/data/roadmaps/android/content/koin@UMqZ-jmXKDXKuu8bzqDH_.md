# Koin

Koin is a lightweight dependency injection framework developed specifically for Kotlin developers. It uses functional resolution only - no proxy, no code generation, no reflection, and offers simplicity by leveraging Kotlin's language features. While Koin is not related to the Android platform, it provides specific extensions enabling an efficient integration into your Android applications, including Android Architecture Components and Kotlin Coroutines amongst others.
