# MVP or Model View Presenter

The MVP `Model View Presenter` pattern is a derivative of the well-known MVC `Model View Controller` pattern and is one of the most popular patterns for organizing the presentation layer in Android applications.

MVP is divided into three components:

- `Model`: Responsible for managing the data input to the app. This can often be an Interactor or UseCase, handling the business logic and data operations.
- `View`: Takes care of updating the graphical part of the application. It acts as a passive view, only receiving data and requesting actions to be performed.
- `Presenter`: Handles all the logic related to the graphical interface that the View requests. It provides the View with the data it needs to display on the screen.
