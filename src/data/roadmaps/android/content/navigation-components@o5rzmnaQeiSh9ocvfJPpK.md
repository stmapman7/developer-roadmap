# Navigation Components

The **Navigation Components** are part of Android Jetpack and are designed to simplify the implementation of navigation in your Android app. These components help you follow best practices, handle deep linking, and provide a consistent user experience across deep and conditional navigation. They also automate many common tasks, such as handling Up and Back actions correctly across many different types of devices. The Navigation component consists of three key parts which are Navigation graph, NavHost, and NavController.
