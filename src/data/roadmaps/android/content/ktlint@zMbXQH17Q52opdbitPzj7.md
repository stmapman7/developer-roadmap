# Ktlint

`ktlint` is a static code analysis tool. It enforces a highly consistent style and adheres extensively to the official Kotlin coding conventions. `ktlint` does not have any configuration options (by design). The only exceptions are disabling specific rule(s) and specifying indentation size. `ktlint` can check, as well as automatically fix your code. Its main goal is to bring unified code style to your project. It works on the command line as well, so it can be hooked up into your continuous integration pipeline. It also has Ant, Gradle and Maven wrappers. You can use Ktlint on any Android/Kotlin project, as long as you have Gradle or Maven installed.
