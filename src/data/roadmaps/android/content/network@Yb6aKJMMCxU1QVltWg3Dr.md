# Network

In Android, the `Network` component offers vital capabilities that enable communication and interaction among users, between users and remote servers, and between users and cloud services. Android provides a variety of APIs and services to interact with networks. The primary APIs are the `ConnectivityManager`, `WifiManager`, `TelephonyManager`, and `BluetoothManager` APIs, among others. ConnectivityManager, for example, can tell you about network connectivity changes.
