# MVVM 

The `Model-View-ViewModel` (MVVM) pattern is a software architectural pattern commonly used in UI development. It is designed to separate the concerns of an application, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

Components:

- `Model`: Refers either to a domain model, which represents real state content (an object-oriented approach), or to the data access layer, which represents content.
- `View`: The view is the structure, layout, and appearance of what a user sees on the screen.
- `View model`: The view model is an abstraction of the view exposing public properties and commands. The view model has been described as a state of the data in the model.
