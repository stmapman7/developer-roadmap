# Implicit Intents

**Implicit Intents** do not specify the target component explicitly like Explicit Intents. Instead, they allow the system to find a suitable component matching the Intent description to handle the request. The system will find an activity that can handle this intent by comparing the `<intent-filter>` section in the `AndroidManifest.xml` of all apps installed on the device against the Implicit Intent.
