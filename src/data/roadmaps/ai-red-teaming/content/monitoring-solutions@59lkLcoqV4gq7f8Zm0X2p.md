# Monitoring Solutions

AI Red Teamers interact with monitoring tools primarily to test their effectiveness (evasion) or potentially exploit vulnerabilities within them. Understanding tools like IDS (Snort, Suricata), network analyzers (Wireshark), and SIEMs helps red teamers simulate attacks that might bypass or target these defensive systems.
