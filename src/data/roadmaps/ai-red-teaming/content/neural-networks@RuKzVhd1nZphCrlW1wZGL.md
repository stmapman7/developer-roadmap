# Neural Networks

Understanding neural network architectures (layers, nodes, activation functions) is vital for AI Red Teamers. This knowledge allows for targeted testing, such as crafting adversarial examples that exploit specific activation functions or identifying potential vulnerabilities related to network depth or connectivity. It provides insight into the 'black box' for more effective white/grey-box testing.
