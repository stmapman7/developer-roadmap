# Vulnerability Assessment

While general vulnerability assessment scans infrastructure, AI Red Teaming extends this to assess vulnerabilities specific to the AI model and its unique interactions. This includes probing for prompt injection flaws, testing for adversarial example robustness, checking for data privacy leaks, and evaluating safety alignment failures â€“ weaknesses not typically found by standard IT vulnerability scanners.
