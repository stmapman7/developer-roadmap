# NoSQL vs SQL

NoSQL and SQL are two distinct paradigms for managing and storing data in databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational and use a structured schema to define data types and relationships, making them ideal for complex queries and transactions. They ensure data integrity and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which are crucial for applications requiring reliable transactions. In contrast, NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer a flexible schema, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.
