# Regular Expression

Regular expressions in MongoDB are patterns used to match strings within documents in a collection. They are implemented using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) syntax, allowing for complex string matching capabilities. In MongoDB queries, regular expressions can be utilized with the `$regex` operator to filter documents based on specific string patterns. For example, a query like `{ "field": { "$regex": "^abc" } }` would match documents where the "field" starts with "abc". Additionally, options such as case insensitivity can be specified using the `$options` operator, enhancing the flexibility of string searches. Regular expressions are particularly useful for tasks like validation, searching, and data extraction within text fields.
