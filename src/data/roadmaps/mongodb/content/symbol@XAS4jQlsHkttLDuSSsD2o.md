# Symbol

The symbol is often used in the context of BSON (Binary JSON) data types, which allows for the representation of various data structures. While MongoDB does not have a specific "symbol" data type like some programming languages, it utilizes BSON to store data efficiently, enabling developers to work with complex data types and structures seamlessly.
