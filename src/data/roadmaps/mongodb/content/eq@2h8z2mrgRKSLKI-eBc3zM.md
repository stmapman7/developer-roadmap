# $eq

The `$eq`operator in MongoDB matches documents where a field value equals a specified value. It performs exact equality comparison and is the default behavior when using field: value syntax. `$eq`supports all BSON data types including nested documents and arrays, enabling precise matching in queries. It's fundamental for filtering documents by specific field values in find operations.
