# $ne

The `$ne` (not equal) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is not equal to a specified value. It performs inverse equality comparison and excludes documents with matching values, including exact matches and type equivalence. `$ne` is fundamental for exclusion filtering, finding outliers, and creating queries that avoid specific values or patterns.
