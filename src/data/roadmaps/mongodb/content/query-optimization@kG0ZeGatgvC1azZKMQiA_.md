# Query Optimization

Query optimization in MongoDB involves analyzing and improving query performance through various techniques including proper indexing strategies, query plan analysis, and efficient query structure design. It encompasses understanding how MongoDB's query planner works, using tools like `explain()` to analyze query execution, creating appropriate indexes to support common query patterns, avoiding inefficient operations like full collection scans, and structuring queries to take advantage of MongoDB's document model and aggregation framework for optimal performance and resource utilization.
