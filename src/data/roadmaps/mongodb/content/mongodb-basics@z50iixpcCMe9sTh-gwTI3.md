# MongoDB Basics

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is designed to store and manage large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB employs a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for a dynamic schema, meaning that documents within the same collection can have different structures, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements. MongoDB supports rich query capabilities, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation, enabling developers to perform complex queries efficiently.
