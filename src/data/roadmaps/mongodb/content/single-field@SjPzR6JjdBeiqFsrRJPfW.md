# Single Field Indexes

Single field indexes in MongoDB are created on individual document fields to optimize queries filtering, sorting, or ranging on that specific field. They can be ascending (1) or descending (-1) and automatically optimize equality, range, and sort operations. Single field indexes are the simplest index type and form the foundation for more complex indexing strategies.
