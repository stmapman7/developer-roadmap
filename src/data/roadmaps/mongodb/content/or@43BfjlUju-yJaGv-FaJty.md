# $or

The `$or` operator in MongoDB performs logical OR operation on multiple query expressions, returning documents that satisfy at least one of the specified conditions. It accepts an array of query expressions and enables alternative matching criteria. `$or` is essential for flexible querying when documents can match any of several different conditions or field combinations.
