# $gte

The `$gte` (greater than or equal to) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is greater than or equal to a specified value. It provides inclusive comparison for range queries, date boundaries, and numeric filtering. `$gte` is particularly useful for minimum threshold queries, start date filtering, and creating inclusive lower bounds in data selection criteria.
