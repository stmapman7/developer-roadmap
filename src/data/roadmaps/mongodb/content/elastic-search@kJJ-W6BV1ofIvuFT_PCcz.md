# Elastic Search

The MongoDB Elasticsearch connector enables seamless integration between MongoDB and Elasticsearch, allowing you to automatically synchronize data from MongoDB collections to Elasticsearch indices for powerful full-text search, analytics, and visualization capabilities. This connector streams data changes in real-time using MongoDB's change streams, transforms documents as needed, and maintains data consistency between the two systems, making it ideal for applications that need both MongoDB's flexible document storage and Elasticsearch's advanced search and aggregation features. It's particularly useful for building search-heavy applications, log analytics systems, and business intelligence dashboards that require complex text search, faceted search, and real-time data analysis capabilities.
