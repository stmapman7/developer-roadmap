The `$group` aggregation stage groups documents by specified identifier expressions and applies accumulator operators like `$sum, $avg, $max, $min, and $push`. It's essential for data aggregation, calculating statistics, and creating summary reports. `$group` can group by single or multiple fields and supports complex expressions for dynamic grouping criteria.
