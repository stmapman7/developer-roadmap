# Replica Sets

Replica Sets in MongoDB provide high availability and data redundancy through a group of mongod instances that maintain identical data copies. The primary node handles write operations while secondary nodes replicate data and can serve read operations. Automatic failover ensures continuous service if the primary becomes unavailable, with secondary nodes electing a new primary to maintain database availability.
