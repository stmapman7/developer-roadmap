# $not

The `$not` operator in MongoDB performs logical negation on a query expression, returning documents that do not match the specified condition. It accepts a single query expression and inverts its result. $not is useful for excluding specific patterns, finding documents that don't meet certain criteria, and creating inverse filters in complex queries.
