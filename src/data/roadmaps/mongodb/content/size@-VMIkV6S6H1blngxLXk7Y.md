# $size

The `$size` operator in MongoDB matches documents where an array field has exactly the specified number of elements. It only works with arrays and requires an exact count match, not range queries. `$size` is useful for validating array lengths, filtering documents by array dimensions, and ensuring data consistency in array-based document structures.
