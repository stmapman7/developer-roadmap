# delete() and Related Methods

Delete operations remove documents from MongoDB collections using `deleteOne()` for single document removal and `deleteMany()` for multiple documents. These methods use query filters to specify which documents to delete and support write concerns for reliability. Additional methods include `findOneAndDelete()` for atomic read-and-delete operations and `drop()` for removing entire collections.
