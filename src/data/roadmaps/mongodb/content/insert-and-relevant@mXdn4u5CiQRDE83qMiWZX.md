# insert() and Related Methods

Insert operations add new documents to MongoDB collections using `insertOne()` for single documents and `insertMany()` for multiple documents. These methods support options like ordered/unordered inserts, write concerns, and automatic ObjectId generation. MongoDB also provides legacy `insert()` method and supports upsert operations through update methods when documents don't exist.
