# $gt

The `$gt` (greater than) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is greater than a specified value. It works with numbers, dates, strings (lexicographically), and other comparable BSON types. `$gt` is essential for range queries, date filtering, and numeric comparisons. Combined with other operators, it enables complex filtering conditions for data analysis and reporting.
