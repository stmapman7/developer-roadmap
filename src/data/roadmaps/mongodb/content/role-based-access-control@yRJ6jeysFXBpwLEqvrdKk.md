# Role-based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in MongoDB is a security framework that manages user permissions by assigning roles that define specific privileges and access levels to database resources. It allows administrators to create custom roles with granular permissions for actions like read, write, or administrative operations on specific databases, collections, or even individual fields, ensuring users only have access to the resources they need for their job functions. This approach simplifies security management by grouping permissions into logical roles rather than managing individual user permissions, making it easier to maintain consistent security policies and comply with the principle of least privilege in enterprise environments.
