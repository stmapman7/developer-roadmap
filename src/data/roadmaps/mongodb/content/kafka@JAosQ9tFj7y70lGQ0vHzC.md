# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streaming. It is primarily used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records, store those records in a fault-tolerant way, and process them in real-time.
