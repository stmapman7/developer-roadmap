# MongoDB Security

MongoDB security encompasses authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing, and network security features. It includes role-based access control (RBAC), field-level security, encryption in transit and at rest, and comprehensive audit logging. MongoDB provides multiple authentication mechanisms including SCRAM, x.509 certificates, LDAP, and Kerberos to secure database access and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
