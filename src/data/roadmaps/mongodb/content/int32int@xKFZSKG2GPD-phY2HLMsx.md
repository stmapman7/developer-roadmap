Int32 data type in MongoDB stores 32-bit signed integers ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. This type provides exact integer representation without floating-point precision issues and takes less storage space than doubles. Int32 is ideal for counters, IDs, and whole numbers where precision is critical and the value range fits within 32-bit limits.
