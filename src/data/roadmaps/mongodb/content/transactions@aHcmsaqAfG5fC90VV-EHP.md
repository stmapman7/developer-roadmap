# Transactions

Transactions in MongoDB provide ACID guarantees for multi-document operations, ensuring data consistency across multiple operations. They support read and write operations spanning multiple documents, collections, and databases within a single atomic unit. Transactions use snapshot isolation and optimistic concurrency control, making them essential for applications requiring strict data integrity and consistency.
