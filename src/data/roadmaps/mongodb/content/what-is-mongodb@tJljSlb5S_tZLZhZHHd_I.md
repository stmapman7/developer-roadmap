# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database designed for scalability, flexibility, and high performance. It stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) format, allowing for the representation of complex data structures and enabling developers to work with unstructured or semi-structured data easily. MongoDB provides a rich query language, supports horizontal scaling through sharding, and offers features like indexing, aggregation, and real-time analytics.
