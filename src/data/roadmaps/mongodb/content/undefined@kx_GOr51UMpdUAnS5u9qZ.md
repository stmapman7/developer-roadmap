# Undefined

The Undefined type is a BSON data type that represents a value that is not defined. It is primarily used to indicate that a field does not have a value or that a variable has not been assigned a value. However, the Undefined type is rarely used in practice, as it has been deprecated in favor of using `null` to represent the absence of a value. The use of `null` is more common and recommended for indicating missing or non-existent data in documents.
