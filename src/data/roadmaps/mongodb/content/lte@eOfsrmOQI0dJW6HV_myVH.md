# $lte

The `$lte` (less than or equal to) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is less than or equal to a specified value. It provides inclusive upper bound comparison for range queries, end date filtering, and maximum value constraints. `$lte` is essential for creating inclusive upper limits in queries and combining with $gte for complete range specifications.
