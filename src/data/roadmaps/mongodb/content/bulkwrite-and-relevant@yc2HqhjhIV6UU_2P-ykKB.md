# bulkWrite() and Related Methods

`bulkWrite()` in MongoDB performs multiple write operations in a single command, improving performance through reduced network round trips. It supports mixed operations including inserts, updates, deletes, and replaces with options for ordered or unordered execution. Bulk operations provide error handling, write concern configuration, and significant performance benefits for high-volume data manipulation tasks.
