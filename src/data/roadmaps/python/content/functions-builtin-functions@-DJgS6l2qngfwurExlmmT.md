# Functions

In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that executes a certain functionality when it is called. Functions are integral parts of every programming language because they help make your code more modular and reusable. In Python, we define a function with the `def` keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.

Example
-------

    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    
    
    greet("Roadmap.sh")
