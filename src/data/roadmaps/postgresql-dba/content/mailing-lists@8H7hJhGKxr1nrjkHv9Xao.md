# Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are an essential part of PostgreSQL's development community. They provide a platform for collaboration, discussion, and problem-solving. By participating in these lists, you can contribute to the development of PostgreSQL, share your knowledge with others, and stay informed about the latest updates, improvements, and conferences.

PostgreSQL's development community offers a variety of mailing lists for discussions, announcements, and contributions. Key lists include **pgsql-hackers** for core development and feature discussions, **pgsql-announce** for official announcements, **pgsql-general** for general usage and administration queries, **pgsql-novice** for beginners seeking advice, and **pgsql-docs** for documentation-related contributions. Regional and language-specific lists are also available. To engage, subscribe to a mailing list that matches your interests, introduce yourself, read the archives for context, and participate in discussions. For guidelines, follow the Mailing List Etiquette.
