# What are Relational Databases?

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and organizes data in a structured format called tables. These tables are made up of rows, also known as records or tuples, and columns, which are also called attributes or fields. The term "relational" comes from the fact that these tables can be related to one another through keys and relationships.
