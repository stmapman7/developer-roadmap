# Relational Model

The relational model is an approach to organizing and structuring data using tables, also referred to as "relations". It was first introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970 and has since become the foundation for most database management systems (DBMS), including PostgreSQL. This model organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a single record and each column represents an attribute or field of the record.
