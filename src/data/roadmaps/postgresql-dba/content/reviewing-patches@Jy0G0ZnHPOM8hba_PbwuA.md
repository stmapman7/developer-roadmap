# Reviewing Patches

Reviewing patches is a vital contribution to PostgreSQL, ensuring quality control, maintaining project standards, and helping new contributors understand the system's internals. By identifying bugs, improving performance, and ensuring proper documentation and test coverage, reviewers uphold PostgreSQL's reliability and stability. To participate, subscribe to the *pgsql-hackers mailing list*, explore patches in the *commitfest schedule*, and provide constructive feedback on correctness, performance, and code quality. Engaging in this collaborative process is an impactful way to support the PostgreSQL community.
