# Configuring PostgreSQL

Configuring PostgreSQL involves modifying several key configuration files to optimize performance, security, and functionality. The primary configuration files are postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and pg_ident.conf, typically located in the PostgreSQL data directory. By properly configuring these files, you can tailor PostgreSQL to better fit your specific needs and environment.
