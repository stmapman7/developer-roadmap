# Object Model in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). That means it combines features of both relational (RDBMS) and object-oriented databases (OODBMS). The object model in PostgreSQL provides features like user-defined data types, inheritance, and polymorphism, which enhances its capabilities beyond a typical SQL-based RDBMS.
