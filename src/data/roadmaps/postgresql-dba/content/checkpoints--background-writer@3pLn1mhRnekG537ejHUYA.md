# Checkpoints and Background Writer

In PostgreSQL, checkpoints and the background writer are essential for maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance. Checkpoints periodically write all modified data (dirty pages) from the shared buffers to the disk, ensuring that the database can recover to a consistent state after a crash. This process is controlled by settings such as `checkpoint_timeout`, `checkpoint_completion_target`, and `max_wal_size`, balancing between write performance and recovery time. The background writer continuously flushes dirty pages to disk in the background, smoothing out the I/O workload and reducing the amount of work needed during checkpoints. This helps to maintain steady performance and avoid spikes in disk activity. Proper configuration of these mechanisms is crucial for ensuring efficient disk I/O management and overall database stability.
