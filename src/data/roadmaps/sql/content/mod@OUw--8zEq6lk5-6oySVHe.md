# MOD

The `MOD` function in SQL calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. It takes two arguments: the dividend and the divisor. `MOD` returns the remainder of the division operation, which is useful for various mathematical operations, including checking for odd/even numbers, implementing cyclic behaviors, or distributing data evenly. The syntax and exact behavior may vary slightly between different database systems, with some using the % operator instead of the `MOD` keyword.
