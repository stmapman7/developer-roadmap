# LOWER

The `LOWER` function in SQL converts all characters in a specified string to lowercase. It's a string manipulation function that takes a single argument (the input string) and returns the same string with all alphabetic characters converted to their lowercase equivalents. `LOWER` is useful for standardizing data, making case-insensitive comparisons, or formatting output. It doesn't affect non-alphabetic characters or numbers in the string. `LOWER` is commonly used in data cleaning, search operations, and ensuring consistent data representation across different systems.
