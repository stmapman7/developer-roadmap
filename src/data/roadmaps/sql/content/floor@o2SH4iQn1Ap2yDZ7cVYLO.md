# FLOOR

The SQL `FLOOR` function is used to round down any specific decimal or numeric value to its nearest whole integer. The returned number will be less than or equal to the number given as an argument.

One important aspect to note is that the `FLOOR` function's argument must be a number and it always returns an integer.
