# HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used in combination with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter the results of `GROUP BY`. It is used to mention conditions on the group functions, like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX` or `MIN`.

It's important to note that where `WHERE` clause introduces conditions on individual rows, `HAVING` introduces conditions on groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause.

Also note, `HAVING` applies to summarized group records, whereas `WHERE` applies to individual records.
