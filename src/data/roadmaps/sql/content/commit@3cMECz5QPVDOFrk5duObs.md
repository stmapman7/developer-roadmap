# COMMIT

The SQL COMMIT command is used to save all the modifications made by the current transaction to the database. A COMMIT command ends the current transaction and makes permanent all changes performed in the transaction. It is a way of ending your transaction and saving your changes to the database.

After the SQL COMMIT statement is executed, it can not be rolled back, which means you can't undo the operations. COMMIT command is used when the user is satisfied with the changes made in the transaction, and these changes can now be made permanent in the database.
