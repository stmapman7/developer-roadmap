# ROUND

The `ROUND` function in SQL is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places. It takes two arguments: the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places to round to. If the second argument is omitted, the function rounds the number to the nearest whole number. For positive values of the second argument, the number is rounded to the specified decimal places; for negative values, it rounds to the nearest ten, hundred, thousand, etc. The `ROUND` function is useful for formatting numerical data for reporting or ensuring consistent precision in calculations.
