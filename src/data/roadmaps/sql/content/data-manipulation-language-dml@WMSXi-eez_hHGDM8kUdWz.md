# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL used to manage data within database objects. It includes commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, which allow users to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from tables. DML statements operate on the data itself rather than the database structure, enabling users to interact with the stored information. These commands are essential for day-to-day database operations, data analysis, and maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the data within a database system.
