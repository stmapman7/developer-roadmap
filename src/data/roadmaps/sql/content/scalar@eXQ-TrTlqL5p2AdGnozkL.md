# Scalar

A scalar value is a single data item, as opposed to a set or array of values. Scalar subqueries are queries that return exactly one column and one row, often used in `SELECT` statements, `WHERE` clauses, or as part of expressions. Scalar functions in SQL return a single value based on input parameters. Understanding scalar concepts is crucial for writing efficient and precise SQL queries.
