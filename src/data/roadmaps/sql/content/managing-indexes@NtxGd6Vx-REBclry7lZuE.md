# Managing Indexes

Managing indexes in SQL involves creating, modifying, and dropping indexes to optimize database performance. This process includes identifying columns that benefit from indexing (frequently queried or used in JOIN conditions), creating appropriate index types (e.g., single-column, composite, unique), and regularly analyzing index usage and effectiveness. Database administrators must balance the improved query performance that indexes provide against the overhead they introduce for data modification operations. Proper index management also includes periodic maintenance tasks like rebuilding or reorganizing indexes to maintain their efficiency as data changes over time.
