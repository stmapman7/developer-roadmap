# Row_number

ROW_NUMBER() is a SQL window function that assigns a unique, sequential integer to each row within a partition of a result set. It's useful for creating row identifiers, implementing pagination, or finding the nth highest/lowest value in a group. The numbering starts at 1 for each partition and continues sequentially, allowing for versatile data analysis and manipulation tasks.
