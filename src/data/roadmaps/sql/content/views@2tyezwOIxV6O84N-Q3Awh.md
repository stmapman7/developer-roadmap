# Views

Views in SQL are virtual tables based on the result set of an SQL statement. They act as a saved query that can be treated like a table, offering several benefits:

- Simplifying complex queries by encapsulating joins and subqueries
- Providing an additional security layer by restricting access to underlying tables
- Presenting data in a more relevant format for specific users or applications

Views can be simple (based on a single table) or complex (involving multiple tables, subqueries, or functions). Some databases support updatable views, allowing modifications to the underlying data through the view. Materialized views, available in some systems, store the query results, improving performance for frequently accessed data at the cost of additional storage and maintenance overhead.
