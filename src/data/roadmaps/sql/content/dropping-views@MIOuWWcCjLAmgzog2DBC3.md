# Dropping Views

Dropping views in SQL involves using the `DROP VIEW` statement to remove an existing view from the database. This operation permanently deletes the view definition, but it doesn't affect the underlying tables from which the view was created. Dropping a view is typically done when the view is no longer needed, needs to be replaced with a different definition, or as part of database maintenance. It's important to note that dropping a view can impact other database objects or applications that depend on it, so caution should be exercised when performing this operation.
