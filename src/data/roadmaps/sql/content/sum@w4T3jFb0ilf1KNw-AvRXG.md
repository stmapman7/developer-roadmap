# SUM

SUM is an aggregate function in SQL used to calculate the total of a set of values. It's commonly used with numeric columns in combination with GROUP BY clauses to compute totals for different categories or groups within the data. SUM is essential for financial calculations, statistical analysis, and generating summary reports from database tables. It ignores NULL values and can be used in conjunction with other aggregate functions for complex data analysis.
