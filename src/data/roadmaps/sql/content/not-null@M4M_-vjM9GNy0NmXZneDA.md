# NOT NULL

The `NOT NULL` constraint in SQL ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. Thus, every row/record must contain a value for that column. It is a way to enforce certain fields to be mandatory while inserting records or updating records in a table.

For instance, if you're designing a table for employee data, you might want to ensure that the employee's `id` and `name` are always provided. In this case, you'd use the `NOT NULL` constraint.
