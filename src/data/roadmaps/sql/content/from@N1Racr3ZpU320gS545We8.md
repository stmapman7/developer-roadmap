# FROM

The `FROM` clause in SQL specifies the tables from which the retrieval should be made. It is an integral part of `SELECT` statements and variants of `SELECT` like `SELECT INTO` and `SELECT WHERE`. `FROM` can be used to join tables as well. 

Typically, `FROM` is followed by space delimited list of tables in which the SELECT operation is to be executed. If you need to pull data from multiple tables, you would separate each table with a comma.
