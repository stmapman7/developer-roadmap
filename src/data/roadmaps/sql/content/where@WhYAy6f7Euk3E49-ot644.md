# WHERE

SQL provides a WHERE clause that is basically used to filter the records. If the condition specified in the WHERE clause satisfies, then only it returns the specific value from the table. You should use the WHERE clause to filter the records and fetching only the necessary records.

The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statement, but it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc., which we will learn in subsequent chapters.
