# Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are precompiled database objects that encapsulate a set of SQL statements and logic. Stored procedures can perform complex operations and are typically used for data manipulation, while functions are designed to compute and return values. Both improve performance by reducing network traffic and allowing code reuse. They also enhance security by providing a layer of abstraction between the application and the database.
