# Column

In SQL, columns are used to categorize the data in a table. A column serves as a structure that stores a specific type of data (ints, str, bool, etc.) in a table. Each column in a table is designed with a type, which configures the data that it can hold. Using the right column types and size can help to maintain data integrity and optimize performance.
