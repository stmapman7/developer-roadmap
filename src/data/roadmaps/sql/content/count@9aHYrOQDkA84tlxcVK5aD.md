# COUNT

`COUNT` is an SQL aggregate function that returns the number of rows that match the specified criteria. It can be used to count all rows in a table, non-null values in a specific column, or rows that meet certain conditions when combined with a `WHERE` clause. `COUNT` is often used in data analysis, reporting, and performance optimization queries to determine the size of datasets or the frequency of particular values.
