# ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns. By default, the sorting is in ascending order, but you can specify descending order using the `DESC` keyword. The clause can sort by numeric, date, or text values, and multiple columns can be sorted by listing them in the `ORDER BY` clause, each with its own sorting direction. This clause is crucial for organizing data in a meaningful sequence, such as ordering by a timestamp to show the most recent records first, or alphabetically by name.
