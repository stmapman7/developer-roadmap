# Sub Queries

Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are SQL queries embedded within another query. They can be used in various parts of SQL statements, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses. Subqueries allow for complex data retrieval and manipulation by breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts. They're particularly useful for creating dynamic criteria, performing calculations, or comparing sets of results.
