# DATEADD

`DATEADD` is an SQL function used to add or subtract a specified time interval to a date or datetime value. It typically takes three arguments: the interval type (e.g., day, month, year), the number of intervals to add or subtract, and the date to modify. This function is useful for date calculations, such as finding future or past dates, calculating durations, or generating date ranges. The exact syntax and name of this function may vary slightly between different database management systems (e.g., `DATEADD` in SQL Server, `DATE_ADD` in MySQL).
