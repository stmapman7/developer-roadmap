# GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` is an SQL clause used in `SELECT` statements to arrange identical data into groups. It's typically used with aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) to perform calculations on each group of rows. `GROUP BY` collects data across multiple records and groups the results by one or more columns, allowing for analysis of data at a higher level of granularity. This clause is fundamental for generating summary reports, performing data analysis, and creating meaningful aggregations of data in relational databases.
