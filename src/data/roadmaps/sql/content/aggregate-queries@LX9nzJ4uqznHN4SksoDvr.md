# Aggregate Queries

Aggregate queries in SQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of data, returning a single summary value or grouped results. These queries typically involve the use of aggregate functions, such as:

	•	COUNT(): Returns the number of rows that match a specific condition.
	•	SUM(): Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
	•	AVG(): Computes the average value of a numeric column.
	•	MIN() and MAX(): Find the smallest and largest values in a column, respectively.
	•	GROUP BY: Used to group rows that share a common value in specified columns, allowing aggregate functions to be applied to each group.
	•	HAVING: Filters the results of a GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition, similar to WHERE but for groups.
