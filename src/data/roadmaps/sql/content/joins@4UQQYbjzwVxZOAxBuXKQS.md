# JOINs

SQL `JOINs` are clauses used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They allow retrieval of data from multiple tables in a single query, enabling complex data analysis and reporting. The main types of `JOINs` include:
-  `INNER JOIN` (returns matching rows from both tables)
-  `LEFT JOIN` (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right)
-  `RIGHT JOIN` (opposite of `LEFT JOIN`)
-  `FULL JOIN` (returns all rows when there's a match in either table)

  `JOINs` are fundamental to relational database operations, facilitating data integration and exploration across related datasets.
