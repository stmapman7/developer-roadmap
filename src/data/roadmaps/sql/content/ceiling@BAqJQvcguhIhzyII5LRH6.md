# CEILING

The `CEILING()` function in SQL returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given numeric value. It's useful when you need to round up a number to the nearest whole number, regardless of whether the number is already an integer or a decimal. For example, `CEILING(4.2)` would return `5`, and `CEILING(-4.7)` would return `-4`. This function is commonly used in scenarios where rounding up is necessary, such as calculating the number of pages needed to display a certain number of items when each page has a fixed capacity.
