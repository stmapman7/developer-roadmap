# Indexes

Indexes in SQL are database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables. They work similarly to book indexes, providing a quick lookup mechanism for finding rows with specific column values. Indexes create a separate data structure that allows the database engine to locate data without scanning the entire table. While they speed up `SELECT` queries, indexes can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations because the index structure must be updated. Proper index design is crucial for optimizing database performance, especially for large tables or frequently queried columns.
