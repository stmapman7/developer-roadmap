# UPPER

UPPER() is a string function in SQL used to convert all characters in a specified string to uppercase. This function is particularly useful for data normalization, case-insensitive comparisons, or formatting output. UPPER() typically works on alphabetic characters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It's often used in SELECT statements to display data, in WHERE clauses for case-insensitive searches, or in data manipulation operations. Most SQL databases also provide a complementary LOWER() function for converting to lowercase. When working with international character sets, it's important to be aware of potential locale-specific behavior of UPPER().
