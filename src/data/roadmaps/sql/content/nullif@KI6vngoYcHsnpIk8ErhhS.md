# NULLIF

`NULLIF` is an SQL function that compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal, otherwise it returns the first expression. It's particularly useful for avoiding division by zero errors or for treating specific values as `NULL` in calculations or comparisons. `NULLIF` takes two arguments and is often used in combination with aggregate functions or in `CASE` statements to handle special cases in data processing or reporting.
