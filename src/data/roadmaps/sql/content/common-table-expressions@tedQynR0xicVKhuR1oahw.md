# CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL are named temporary result sets that exist within the scope of a single `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE` statement. Defined using the `WITH` clause, CTEs act like virtual tables that can be referenced multiple times within a query. They improve query readability, simplify complex queries by breaking them into manageable parts, and allow for recursive queries. CTEs are particularly useful for hierarchical or graph-like data structures and can enhance query performance in some database systems.
