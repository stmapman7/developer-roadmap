# Nested Subqueries

In SQL, a subquery is a query that is nested inside a main query. If a subquery is nested inside another subquery, it is called a nested subquery. They can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements or inside another subquery.

Nested subqueries can get complicated quickly, but they are essential for performing complex database tasks.
