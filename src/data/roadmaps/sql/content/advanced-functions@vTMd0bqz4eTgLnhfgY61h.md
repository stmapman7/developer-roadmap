# Advanced SQL Functions

Advanced SQL functions enable more sophisticated data manipulation and analysis within databases, offering powerful tools for complex queries. Key areas include:

- **String Functions**: Manipulate text data using functions like `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, and `REPLACE` to combine, extract, or modify strings.
- **Date & Time**: Manage temporal data with functions like `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`, and `FORMAT`, allowing for calculations and formatting of dates and times.
- **Numeric Functions**: Perform advanced calculations using functions such as `ROUND`, `FLOOR`, and `CEIL`, providing precision in numerical data processing.
- **Conditional**: Implement logic within queries using functions like `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `NULLIF` to control data flow and handle conditional scenarios.
