# Window Functions

SQL Window functions enable you perform calculations on a set of rows related to the current row. This set of rows is known as a 'window', hence 'Window Functions'. 

These are termed so because they perform a calculation across a set of rows which are related to the current row - somewhat like a sliding window.
