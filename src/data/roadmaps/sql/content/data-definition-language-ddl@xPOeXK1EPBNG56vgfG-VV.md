# Data Definition Language (DDL)

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of database objects. DDL commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE`, which are used to create, modify, delete, and empty database structures such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. These commands allow database administrators and developers to define the database schema, set up relationships between tables, and manage the overall structure of the database. DDL statements typically result in immediate changes to the database structure and can affect existing data.
