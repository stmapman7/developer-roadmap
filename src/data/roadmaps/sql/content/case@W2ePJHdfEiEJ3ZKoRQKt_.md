# CASE

The CASE statement in SQL is used to create conditional logic within a query, allowing you to perform different actions based on specific conditions. It operates like an if-else statement, returning different values depending on the outcome of each condition. The syntax typically involves specifying one or more WHEN conditions, followed by the result for each condition, and an optional ELSE clause for a default outcome if none of the conditions are met.
