# CONCAT

`CONCAT` is an SQL function used to combine two or more strings into a single string. It takes multiple input strings as arguments and returns a new string that is the concatenation of all the input strings in the order they were provided. `CONCAT` is commonly used in `SELECT` statements to merge data from multiple columns, create custom output formats, or generate dynamic SQL statements.
