# Pivot and Unpivot Operations

Pivot and Unpivot operations in SQL are used to transform and reorganize data, making it easier to analyze in different formats. The `PIVOT` operation converts rows into columns, allowing you to summarize data and present it in a more readable, table-like format. For example, it can take sales data by month and convert the months into individual columns. Conversely, the `UNPIVOT` operation does the oppositeâ€”it converts columns back into rows, which is useful for normalizing data that was previously pivoted or to prepare data for certain types of analysis. These operations are particularly useful in reporting and data visualization scenarios, where different perspectives on the same data set are required.
