# DATE

The DATE data type in SQL is used to store calendar dates (typically in the format YYYY-MM-DD). It represents a specific day without any time information. DATE columns are commonly used for storing birthdates, event dates, or any other data that requires only day-level precision. SQL provides various functions to manipulate and format DATE values, allowing for date arithmetic, extraction of date components, and comparison between dates. The exact range of valid dates may vary depending on the specific database management system being used.
