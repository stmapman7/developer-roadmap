# MAX

`MAX` is an aggregate function in SQL that returns the highest value in a set of values. It can be used with numeric, date, or string data types, selecting the maximum value from a specified column. `MAX` is often used in combination with `GROUP BY` to find the highest value within each group. This function is useful for various data analysis tasks, such as finding the highest salary, the most recent date, or the alphabetically last name in a dataset.
