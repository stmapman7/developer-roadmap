# Data Integrity and Security

Data integrity and security in SQL encompass measures and techniques to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and protection within a database. This includes implementing constraints (like primary keys and foreign keys), using transactions to maintain data consistency, setting up user authentication and authorization, encrypting sensitive data, and regularly backing up the database.

SQL provides various tools and commands to enforce data integrity rules, control access to data, and protect against unauthorized access or data corruption, ensuring the reliability and confidentiality of stored information.
