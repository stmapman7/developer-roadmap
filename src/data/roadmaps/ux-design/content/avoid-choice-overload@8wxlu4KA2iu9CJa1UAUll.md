# Avoid Choice Overload

Choice overload occurs when users face too many options, leading to decision paralysis, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. As a UX designer, it's important to simplify decision-making by limiting the number of options to 5-7 at a time, prioritizing the most relevant choices. Organizing options into logical categories with visual cues can help users navigate their selections more easily. Implementing smart defaults can streamline decisions by pre-selecting commonly used options, while advanced filtering and sorting features allow users to refine their choices in complex scenarios. By addressing choice overload with these strategies, you can enhance user experience and facilitate a more seamless decision-making process.
