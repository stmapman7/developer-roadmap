# Stephen Wendel's CREATE Action Funnel

Stephen Wendel's CREATE Action Funnel is a behavioral design framework aimed at helping individuals or organizations encourage specific behaviors in others, especially in the context of product design. It breaks down the process of motivating action into six key stages. Each stage helps identify where users might drop off or face barriers, allowing designers or strategists to address these pain points effectively. These stages are:

- **CUE:** The user must notice a cue or prompt that tells them to act. This could be a notification, a visual element, or any kind of reminder.

- **REACTION:** The user must react positively to the cue. This stage involves emotional and cognitive processing, where the individual decides if the action is relevant or attractive.

- **EVALUATION:** The user evaluates whether the action is worth their time, energy, or resources. They assess the benefits versus the effort required.

- **ABILITY:** The user must feel capable of taking the action. This involves ensuring that the action is easy enough to do and aligns with their skills and resources.

- **TIMING:** The action needs to happen at the right time. Users need to have the opportunity and be in the right context to act.

- **EXECUTION:** Finally, the action must be carried out successfully. This is the stage where the behavior is completed.

The CREATE Action Funnel is helpful for product designers, marketers, or behavior change professionals, as it provides a structured way to understand user actions and design interventions to improve completion rates. It identifies and solves the gaps that occur between intention and action.
