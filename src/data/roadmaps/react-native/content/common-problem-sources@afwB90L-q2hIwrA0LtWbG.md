# Common Problem Sources

In React Native, several common issues can impact application performance. Excessive console logs can slow down the app, particularly in debug mode, so it's advisable to minimize their use and remove unnecessary logs before release. Heavy and unoptimized images can also cause performance problems; therefore, it's important to optimize image size and resolution and use the `resizeMode` prop on the `Image` component for better rendering. Additionally, inline functions and styles can lead to unnecessary re-renders, so defining them outside the component's render method is recommended. While using `React.PureComponent` or `React.memo()` can enhance performance, they should be applied judiciously to avoid unnecessary re-renders. For handling large lists, replacing `ListView` with `FlatList` or `SectionList` is crucial for better performance. Lastly, blocking the JavaScript thread with heavy synchronous computations can degrade performance, so it's essential to handle such tasks asynchronously or offload them to native modules. Following these guidelines can help maintain optimal performance in React Native applications.
