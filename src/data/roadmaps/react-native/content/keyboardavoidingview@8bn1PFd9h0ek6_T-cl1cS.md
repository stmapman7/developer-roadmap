# KeyboardAvoidingView

`KeyboardAvoidingView` is a built-in React Native component that automatically adjusts its children components' position when the keyboard opens, preventing them from being obscured by the on-screen keyboard. It's a useful component, particularly for forms and input fields where the user needs to see the text they're typing.
