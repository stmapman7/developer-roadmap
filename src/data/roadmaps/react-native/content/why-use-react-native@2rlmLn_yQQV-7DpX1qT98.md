# Why React Native?

React Native is a popular framework for developing native mobile applications using JavaScript (or TypeScript) and React, offering several compelling advantages for mobile app development. Key benefits include **code reusability**, allowing developers to share a significant portion of the codebase between iOS and Android, which reduces development time and simplifies maintenance. It leverages **familiar React concepts**, making it accessible for those already experienced with ReactJS, as it applies similar principles of components and state management. React Native provides **near-native performance** by directly interacting with native components, avoiding intermediaries like WebView. The framework benefits from a **vast ecosystem** and community support, with numerous libraries and tools that enhance the development process, bolstered by contributions from major companies like Facebook. Additionally, **hot reloading** enables developers to see code changes in real-time on devices or emulators, streamlining the development workflow. Finally, React Native can be **integrated into existing applications**, allowing for flexible enhancements to specific parts of an app.
