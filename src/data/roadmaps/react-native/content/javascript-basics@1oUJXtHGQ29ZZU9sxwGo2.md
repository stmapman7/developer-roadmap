# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a very flexible and versatile programming language, considered as a core technology for web development. This is because it is the only language natively supported by all browsers, allowing developers to add dynamic behavior and create complex user experiences with this language.

There's a lot more to learn in JavaScript but my recommendation is to learn the basics and then learn as you go. You'll learn a lot more by building things than by reading about them.
