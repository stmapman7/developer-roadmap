# SafeAreaView

`SafeAreaView` is a React Native core component that helps to adjust your app's UI elements and layout to accommodate the notches, curved edges, or home indicator on iOS devices. It is particularly useful for the iPhone X and newer iPhone models, as it ensures that content is rendered within the visible portion of the screen.

Keep in mind that `SafeAreaView` only works on iOS devices, and has no effect on Android devices. To handle such cases, you can use platform-specific styles or libraries like `react-native-safe-area-context` which provide more control and customization options for additional platforms.
