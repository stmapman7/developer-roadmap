# Touchables

In React Native, `Touchable` components are used to handle user interactions like taps, long presses, and double-taps on the appropriate elements. Each of these components is from the `react-native` package, except `TouchableScale` which is from `react-native-touchable-scale`. They can be used interchangeably depending on the type of interaction you want to provide. The main `props` used with these components are `onPress`, `onLongPress`, and some component-specific ones like `underlayColor` for `TouchableHighlight`.
