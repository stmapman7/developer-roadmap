# Storage

React Native offers several methods for persisting data locally within applications, each catering to different storage needs and use cases. The primary options include Async Storage, which provides a simple key-value storage system suitable for small-scale data; Expo Secure Store, designed for securely storing sensitive information; Expo File System, which allows for file management and storage; and Expo SQLite, which supports more complex data storage and querying capabilities. When selecting a storage option, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of your app.
