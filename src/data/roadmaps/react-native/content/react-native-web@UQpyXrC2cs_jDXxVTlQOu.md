# React Native Web

React Native Web is an extension of React Native which allows you to run your React Native apps not only on iOS and Android devices, but also on the web. It uses the same components and APIs you're familiar with in React Native, but renders them into the DOM of a webpage instead of native UI elements.

The main goal of React Native Web is to provide a consistent developer experience across platforms, reducing the effort needed to build and maintain multi-platform apps.
