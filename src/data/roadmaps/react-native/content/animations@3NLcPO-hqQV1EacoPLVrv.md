# Animations

React Native supports two types of animations: `Animated` and `LayoutAnimation`. The `Animated` API provides a basic set of methods for creating and managing animations, while the `LayoutAnimation` API provides a way to animate changes from one layout to another.

`Animated` is a declarative API that focuses on handling animation-related calculations. It allows you to create and combine animations with fine-grained control over the specific properties that are being animated. You can use this API to create a variety of effects, such as fading, scaling, and translating components on the screen.

`LayoutAnimation` is a higher-level abstraction for animating changes to the layout. Instead of animating individual properties, you define how the changes should occur and React Native takes care of updating the layout accordingly. This is particularly useful for animating multiple components or modifying the layout in response to user interaction, such as adding/removing/reordering items in a list.
