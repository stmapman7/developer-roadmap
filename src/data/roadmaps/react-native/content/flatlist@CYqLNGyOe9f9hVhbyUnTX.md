`FlatList` is a `React Native` core component that displays a scrolling list of changing, but similarly structured, data. It is an efficient list component that makes use of a limited scrolling `renderWindow`, reducing the memory footprint and creating smooth scrolling. Additionally, `FlatList` supports-Headers, Footers, Pull-to-refresh, and Horizontal scrolling, among other things.
