# expo-secure-store

Expo Secure Store is a built-in package provided by the Expo SDK to store encrypted data securely on users' devices. It is a key-value storage system, but it is not designed to store larger amounts of data such as app databases or complex data structures. It is most appropriate for storing secret keys, access tokens, and small user preferences.
