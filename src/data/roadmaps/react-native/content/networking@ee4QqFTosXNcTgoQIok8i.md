# Networking

Networking in React Native primarily uses the Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest for making network requests. These APIs allow you to retrieve data from remote servers and handle asynchronous operations easily. React Native offers various ways to handle networking tasks like making API calls, sending/receiving data from remote servers, and handling different network protocols.

- Fetch
- HTTP Call Libraries
- Web Sockets

These are the major ways to handle networking tasks in React Native. Choose the method that best suits your specific use case and allows you to take full advantage of the features offered.
