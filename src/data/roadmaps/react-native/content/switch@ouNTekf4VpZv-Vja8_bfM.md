# Switch

A `Switch` is a core component in React Native used to implement a "toggle" or "on-off" input. It provides a UI for the user to switch between two different states, typically true or false. The primary use case is to enable or disable a feature or setting within an application.

`Switch` component has a boolean `value` prop (true for on, false for off) and an `onValueChange` event handler, which is triggered whenever the user toggles the switch.
