# StatusBar

The `StatusBar` component is used to control the appearance of the status bar on the top of the screen. It may strike as a bit unusual since, unlike other React Native components, it doesn't render any visible content. Instead, it sets some native properties that can help customize the look of status bars on Android, iOS, or other platforms.
