# Activity Indicator

The `ActivityIndicator` is a core component in React Native that provides a simple visual indication of some ongoing activity or loading state within your application. It shows a spinning animation, which gives the user feedback that something is happening in the background. This component is particularly useful when fetching data from an external source, like a server, or while performing time-consuming operations.
