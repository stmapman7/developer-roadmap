# Core Components

Core components are the essential building blocks provided by React Native to create a user interface for mobile applications. They are platform-agnostic, meaning they work across both iOS and Android devices. Some of the common core components include:

- `View` is a fundamental component for constructing the user interface. It is equivalent to a `div` in HTML and can be used as a container for other components.
- `Text` is used to display text content in your app. It is similar to the `p` or `span` elements in HTML.
- `TextInput` is a basic input field that allows users to type text into your app. It is similar to the `input` element in HTML.
- `TouchableOpacity` is a wrapper for making elements like `View` and `Text` respond properly to touch events. It provides feedback by reducing the opacity of the wrapped component when pressed.
- `ScrollView` is a scrollable container that allows users to scroll through its content. It is useful when you have content that exceeds the available screen size.
- `FlatList` is used to render a list of items using a performant approach. It only renders items that are currently visible on the screen and removes others to save memory.
