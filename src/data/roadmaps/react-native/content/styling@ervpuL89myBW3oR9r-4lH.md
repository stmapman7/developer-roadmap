# Styling

Styling in React Native is accomplished through JavaScript and uses a subset of CSS properties. Unlike CSS in web development, React Native has its own set of components and styling rules. The main components used for styling are `StyleSheet`, `View`, and `Text`.

`StyleSheet` is a module provided by React Native to manage and optimize styles. It is similar to a CSS stylesheet and helps in creating and working with multiple styles efficiently.
