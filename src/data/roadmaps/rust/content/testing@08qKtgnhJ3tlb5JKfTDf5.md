# Testing

Rust has built-in testing support through `cargo test` and the `#[test]` attribute. Test functions use assertion macros like `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` to verify expected behavior. Organize tests with unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests for comprehensive coverage.
