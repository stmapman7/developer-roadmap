# Relm

`relm` is a declarative, event-driven GUI framework for Rust built on `gtk-rs` and GTK+3. Uses Model-View-Update architecture with async Futures for complex UI interactions. Features widget identification by name, seamless inter-widget communication, and leverages Rust's safe concurrency for dynamic desktop applications.
