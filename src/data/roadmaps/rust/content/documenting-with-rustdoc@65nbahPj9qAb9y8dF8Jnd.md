# Documenting with rustdoc

RustDoc is an invaluable tool within the Rust ecosystem for generating comprehensive and user-friendly documentation directly from your source code. By leveraging special documentation comments (starting with `///` for regular comments and `//!` for crate-level comments), developers can embed Markdown-formatted text, code examples, and even doctests directly alongside their functions, modules, and types. RustDoc then processes these comments to produce static HTML pages, making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand how to use your libraries and applications. This integrated approach not only promotes good documentation habits but also ensures that the documentation remains in sync with the codebase.
