# BinaryHeap

`BinaryHeap<T>` is a priority queue implemented as a max-heap using a binary tree structure stored in an array. The largest element is always at the root, accessible via `peek()`. Supports O(log n) insertion with `push()` and removal with `pop()`. Useful for priority-based algorithms.
