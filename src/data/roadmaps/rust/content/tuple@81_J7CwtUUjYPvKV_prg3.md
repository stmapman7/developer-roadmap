# Tuple

Tuples are fixed-size collections that can hold elements of different types. Access elements using dot notation with zero-based indexing: `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, etc. Example: `let data: (i32, f64, char) = (42, 3.14, 'x');`. Useful for grouping related values of different types and multiple variable assignments.
