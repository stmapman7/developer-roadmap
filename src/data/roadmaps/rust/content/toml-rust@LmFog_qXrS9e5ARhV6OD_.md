# TOML Parsing

`toml-rs` parses and serializes TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) configuration files in Rust. Uses serde for automatic serialization/deserialization between TOML and Rust types. Leverages Rust's trait system and type inference to convert TOML documents into statically-typed Rust structures.
