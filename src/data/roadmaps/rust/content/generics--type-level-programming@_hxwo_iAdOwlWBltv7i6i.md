# Advanced Generics and Type-level Programming

Advanced generics in Rust include `where` clauses for complex bounds, `?Sized` for unsized types, associated types, and higher-kinded types. These enable sophisticated type-level programming, allowing precise control over generic constraints and enabling powerful abstractions while maintaining zero-cost performance.
