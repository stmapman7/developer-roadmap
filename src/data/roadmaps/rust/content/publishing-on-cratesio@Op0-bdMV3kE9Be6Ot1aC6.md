# Publishing on crates.io

Publishing Rust crates involves creating an account on crates.io, preparing proper `Cargo.toml` metadata, and using `cargo publish`. Once published, versions cannot be deleted or overwritten, ensuring dependency stability. The registry serves as Rust's central package repository for sharing libraries.
