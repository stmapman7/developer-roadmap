# Debugging

Rust provides excellent debugging support through `rust-gdb` and `rust-lldb` debuggers, along with built-in macros like `println!`, `dbg!`, and `debug!`. The strict compiler catches many bugs at compile-time, while runtime debugging is enhanced by panic backtraces and comprehensive error messages.
