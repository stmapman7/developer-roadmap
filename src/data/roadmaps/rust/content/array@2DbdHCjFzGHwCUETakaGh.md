# Array

Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type stored consecutively in memory. Size must be known at compile time and cannot change. Syntax: `let arr: [type; size] = [elements];`. Example: `let nums: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];`. Access elements with zero-based indexing: `arr[0]`.
