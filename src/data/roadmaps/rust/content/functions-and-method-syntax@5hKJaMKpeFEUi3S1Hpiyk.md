# Functions and Method Syntax

In Rust, functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Each function can take a set of input variables with their specified types, and may return data of a specified type. The body of a function is contained within curly braces `{}`. Unlike other languages, in Rust, you don't need to end the last statement in a block with a semicolon; omitting the last semicolon of a block in this way turns the last statement into an expression, and the result of this expression becomes the implicit return value of the block.
