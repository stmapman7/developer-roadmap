# Integers

In Rust, integers are a primitive data type that hold whole number values, both positive and negative. Integer types in Rust can be divided into signed and unsigned ones:

- Signed integers, denoted by "i", are those that can hold negative, zero, and positive values.
- Unsigned integers, denoted by "u", only hold zero and positive values.
