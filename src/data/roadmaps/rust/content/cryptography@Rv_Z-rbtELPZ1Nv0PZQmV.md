# Cryptography

Cryptography involves securing data through encryption (making readable data unreadable) and decryption (reversing the process). Rust offers crypto libraries like `ring`, `sodiumoxide`, and `rust-crypto` for hashing, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures with memory-safe implementations.
