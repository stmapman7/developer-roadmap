# What is Rust?

Rust is a modern system programming language focused on performance, safety, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages arenâ€™t good at. Its syntax is similar to C++, but Rust offers better memory safety while maintaining high performance.
