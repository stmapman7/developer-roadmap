# Database and ORM

ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) provide abstraction layers between Rust code and SQL databases. Popular Rust ORMs include Diesel (compile-time safety), SQLx (async with compile-time query checking), and Sea-ORM. They eliminate raw SQL writing while maintaining type safety and performance.
