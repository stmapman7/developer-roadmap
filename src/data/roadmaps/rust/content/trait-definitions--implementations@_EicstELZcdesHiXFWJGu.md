# Trait Definitions and Implementations

Traits define shared behavior as a set of method signatures that types can implement. Define with `trait Name { fn method(&self); }` and implement with `impl TraitName for Type`. Traits enable polymorphism, code reuse, and abstraction while maintaining type safety and zero-cost performance.
