# Futures and Async/Await Paradigm

Futures represent asynchronous computations that produce values or errors eventually. The `async/await` syntax provides ergonomic programming over futures, allowing asynchronous code to look synchronous. Futures are lazy and must be polled to make progress, forming the foundation of Rust's async ecosystem.
