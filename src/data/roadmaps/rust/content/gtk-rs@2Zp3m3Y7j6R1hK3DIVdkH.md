`gtk-rs` provides Rust bindings for GTK+3 and related libraries (GObject, Glib, Cairo, Pango) enabling cross-platform GUI application development. These open-source libraries offer a Rust-friendly interface for GTK components, allowing developers to create graphical applications using Rust with native GTK functionality.
