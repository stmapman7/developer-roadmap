# Installing Rust and Cargo

To install Rust, navigate to the rust official website and download the appropriate installation file (or run the appropriate terminal command) for your operating system. You'll be installing `rustup`, which is the preferred tool for installing, updating, and managing your core Rust tooling. For UNIX systems like Linux and MacOS, installation is as easy as running a single command in the terminal. For Windows, you'll be provided with an '.exe' installer which you need to execute. Further instructions can be found on the download page of the website.
