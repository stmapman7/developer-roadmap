# Error Handling

Rust handles errors through `Result<T, E>` for operations that may fail and `Option<T>` for values that may be absent. `Result` has `Ok(T)` for success and `Err(E)` for errors, while `Option` has `Some(T)` and `None`. Pattern matching and the `?` operator enable elegant error handling and propagation. Rust doesn't use exceptions, eliminating many common error-handling problems.
