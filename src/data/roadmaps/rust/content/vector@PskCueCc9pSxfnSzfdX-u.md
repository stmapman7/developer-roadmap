# Vector

`Vec<T>` is Rust's growable, heap-allocated array that stores elements of the same type contiguously. Unlike arrays, vectors can resize at runtime. Key methods include `push()` to add elements, `pop()` to remove the last element, and `len()` for size. Example: `let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];`
