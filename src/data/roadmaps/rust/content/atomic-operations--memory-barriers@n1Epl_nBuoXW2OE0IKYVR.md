# Atomic Operations and Memory Barriers

Atomic operations provide lock-free concurrency through uninterruptible operations like `load`, `store`, `swap`, and `compare_and_swap`. These low-level primitives enable thread-safe data sharing without locks, forming the foundation for higher-level concurrent abstractions and non-blocking data structures.
