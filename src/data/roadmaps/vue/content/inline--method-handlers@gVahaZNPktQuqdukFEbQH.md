# Inline / Method Handlers

In Vue.js, **inline handlers** are defined directly in the template using expressions, making them suitable for simple tasks. For example, you might use an inline handler to increment a counter. **Method handlers**, on the other hand, are defined in the `methods` option and are better for more complex logic or when reusing functionality across multiple components. They improve code readability and maintainability.
