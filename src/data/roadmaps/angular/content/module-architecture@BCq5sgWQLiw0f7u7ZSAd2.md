# Module Architecture

Angular's **module architecture** uses **NgModules** to organize applications into cohesive units. These modules group related components, directives, pipes, and services, promoting modular development. Key types include the **root module** (entry point), **feature modules** (specific functionality, often lazily loaded), and **shared modules** (reusable code). This approach significantly enhances code organization, scalability, and maintainability.
