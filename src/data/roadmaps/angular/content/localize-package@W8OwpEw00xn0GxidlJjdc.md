# Localize Package

To take advantage of the localization features of Angular, use the Angular CLI to add the `@angular/localize` package to your project. If `@angular/localize` is not installed and you try to build a localized version of your project (for example, while using the i18n attributes in templates), the Angular CLI will generate an error, which would contain the steps that you can take to enable i18n for your project.
