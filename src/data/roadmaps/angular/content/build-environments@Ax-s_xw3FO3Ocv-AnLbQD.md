# Build Environments

You can define different named build configurations for your project, such as `development` and `production`, with different defaults. Each named configuration can have defaults for any of the options that apply to the various builder targets, such as `build`, `serve`, and `test`. The Angular CLI can replace files for each environment if you pass a `--configuration` flag with the named configuration when running a CLI command.
