# Angular Architecture

Angular follows a modular architecture pattern, dividing the application into distinct modules, components, services, and other elements, which enhances code organization and maintainability. The key building blocks include modules, which are containers grouping related components, services, directives, and other elements to ensure proper encapsulation and reusability. Components are the building blocks of Angular applications, representing parts of the user interface with associated logic, consisting of templates, styles, and a class defining behavior. Services encapsulate reusable business logic, data manipulation, and API communication, enabling data and functionality sharing across components.
