# RxJS Operators

RxJS operators are crucial functions that enable the declarative composition of complex asynchronous code. There are two primary types: **Pipeable Operators**, such as `filter()` or `mergeMap()`, which are chained using the `observableInstance.pipe()` method to transform an existing Observable into a new one without altering the original; and **Creation Operators**, like `of()` or `interval()`, which are standalone functions used to generate new Observables from scratch. This modular approach to handling asynchronous data streams greatly enhances code readability and maintainability.
