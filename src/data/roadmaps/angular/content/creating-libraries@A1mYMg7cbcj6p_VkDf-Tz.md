# Creating Libraries

If you have developed features that are suitable for reuse, you can create your own libraries. These libraries can be used locally in your workspace, or you can publish them as npm packages to share with other projects or other Angular developers. Putting code into a separate library is more complex than simply putting everything in one application. It requires more of an investment in time and thought for managing, maintaining, and updating the library. This complexity can pay off when the library is being used in multiple applications.
