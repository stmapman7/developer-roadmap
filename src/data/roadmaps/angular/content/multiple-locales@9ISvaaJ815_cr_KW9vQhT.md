# Multiple Locales

To deploy an Angular application with multiple locales, follow these steps:

1. Place different versions of your app in locale-specific directories
2. Use the HTML `<base>` tag with the `href` attribute to set the base URL for relative links.
3. Deploy each language version in a different subdirectory. Redirect users to their preferred language based on the `Accept-Language` HTTP header.
