# Data Binding

In an Angular template, a binding creates a live connection between a part of the UI created from a template (a DOM element, directive, or component) and the model (the component instance to which the template belongs). This connection can be used to synchronize the view with the model, to notify the model when an event or user action takes place in the view, or both. Angular's Change Detection algorithm is responsible for keeping the view and the model in sync. Bindings always have two parts: a target which will receive the bound value, and a template expression which produces a value from the model.
