# Angular SSG

SSG (Static Site Generator) helps in building the HTML full website during the process of building and serving that HTML page. This method helps to generate the HTML website on the client side before it's served on the server side. Therefore, whenever a user requests a HTML page, the HTML page will be rendered, and secondly, the Angular app will be rendered. The SSG can be used only if your website is static or its content doesn't change frequently.
