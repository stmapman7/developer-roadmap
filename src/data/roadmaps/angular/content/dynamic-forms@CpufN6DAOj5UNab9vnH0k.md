# Dynamic Forms

Dynamic forms in Angular are a flexible way to create forms where the structure (such as form fields and validation rules) is generated at runtime, rather than being hardcoded. By using Angular's `FormBuilder` and `FormGroup`, you can dynamically add, remove, or modify form controls based on user input, data fetched from a server, or other logic. This approach allows for creating complex forms that can adapt to different user scenarios, reducing the need for multiple form templates and making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
