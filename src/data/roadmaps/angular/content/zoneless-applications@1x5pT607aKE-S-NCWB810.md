# Zoneless Applications

Angular 18 introduced an experimental feature called zoneless change detection. This technology removes the need for `Zone.js`, a library that was previously used for change detection in Angular from the beginning. By eliminating `Zone.js`, Angular applications can have faster initial renders, smaller bundle sizes, and simpler debugging.
