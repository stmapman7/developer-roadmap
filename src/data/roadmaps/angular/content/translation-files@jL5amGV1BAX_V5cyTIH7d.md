# Translation Files

After you prepare a component for translation, use the `extract-i18n` Angular CLI command to extract the marked text in the component into a source language file. The marked text includes text marked with `i18n`, attributes marked with `i18n`-attribute, and text tagged with `$localize`. The `extract-i18n` command creates a source language file named `messages.xlf` in the root directory of your project.  If you have multiple language files, add the locale to the file name, like `messages.{locale}.xlf`.
