# Deferrable Views

Deferrable views can be used in component template to defer the loading of select dependencies within that template. Those dependencies include components, directives, and pipes, and any associated CSS. To use this feature, you can declaratively wrap a section of your template in a @defer block which specifies the loading conditions.
