# XSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF or CSRF) protection is a critical security measure designed to prevent a type of malicious exploit where an attacker tricks a web browser into sending an unauthorized request to a trusted site on behalf of a logged-in user. Unlike phishing, which tries to steal credentials, XSRF exploits a user's active session.
