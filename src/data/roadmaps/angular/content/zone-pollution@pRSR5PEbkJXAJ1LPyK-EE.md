# Zone Pollution

`Zone.js` is a signaling mechanism that Angular uses to detect when an application state might have changed. In some cases, scheduled tasks or microtasks donâ€™t make any changes in the data model, which makes running change detection unnecessary. Common examples are `requestAnimationFrame`, `setTimeout` and `setInterval`. You can identify change detection with Angular DevTools, and you can run code outside the Angular zone to avoid unnecessary change detection calls.
