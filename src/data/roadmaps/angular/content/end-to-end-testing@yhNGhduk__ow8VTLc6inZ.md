# End-to-End Testing

End-to-end or (E2E) testing is a form of testing used to assert your entire application works as expected from start to finish or "end-to-end". E2E testing differs from unit testing in that it is completely decoupled from the underlying implementation details of your code. It is typically used to validate an application in a way that mimics the way a user would interact with it. The `ng e2e` command will first check your project for the "e2e" target. If it can't locate it, the CLI will then prompt you which e2e package you would like to use and walk you through the setup.
