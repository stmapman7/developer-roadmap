# Structural Directives

Structural directives are directives applied to an `<ng-template>` element that conditionally or repeatedly renders the content of that `<ng-template>`. If you just wrap elements in an `<ng-template>` without applying a structural directive, those elements will not be rendered.

In Angular, there are three standard structural directives:

- `*ngIf` – conditionally includes a template depending on the value of an expression returned by a Boolean.
- `*ngFor` – makes it simple to iterate over an array.
- `*ngSwitch` – renders each matching view.
