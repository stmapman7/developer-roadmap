Angularâ€™s performance is enhanced through key strategies such as Deferable Views for improved initial load times, Image Optimization techniques to reduce loading overhead, and mitigation of Zone Pollution to streamline change detection. Additionally, addressing Slow Computations enhances runtime efficiency, while Hydration techniques support faster, more interactive server-side rendered applications.
