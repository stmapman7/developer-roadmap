# Introduction to PHP

PHP, also known as Hypertext Preprocessor, is a powerful scripting language used predominantly for creating dynamic web pages and applications. It provides seamless interaction with databases, easier control of content, session tracking, and cookies. Being an open-source language, it's favored by developers for its flexibility, speed, and security. 

Here's a simple PHP code to print a text: 

```php   
  <?php
   echo "Hello, World!";
  ?>
```

Here the "echo" command in PHP helps to output one or more strings.
