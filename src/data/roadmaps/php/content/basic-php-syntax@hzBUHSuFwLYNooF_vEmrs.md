# Basic PHP Syntax

PHP syntax is generally considered similar to C-style syntax, where code blocks are defined with curly braces, variables start with a dollar sign ($), and statements end with a semicolon (;), making it relatively easy to learn for programmers familiar with C-like languages; PHP scripts are embedded within HTML using opening tags "<?php" and closing tags "?>" to mark where PHP code should be executed within a web page.
