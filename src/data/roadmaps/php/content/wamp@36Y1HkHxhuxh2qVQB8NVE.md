# WAMP

WAMP is a popular software stack used for developing PHP web applications on Windows systems. Acting as an abbreviation for Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, WAMP provides all the components necessary to set up a local web server. Apache is used to handle HTTP requests, MySQL manages the databases, and PHP serves as the programming language. The benefit of using WAMP lies in its convenience as it pre-packages all these components, saving time for the developer. You can download WAMP from its official website, then after installation, testing of your PHP scripts can be done locally without needing an internet connection.
