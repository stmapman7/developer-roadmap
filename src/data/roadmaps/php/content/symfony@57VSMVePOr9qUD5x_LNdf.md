# Symfony

Symfony is a set of PHP components and a framework for web projects. It aims to speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications and replace the recurring coding tasks. Symfony uses Composer, a PHP dependency manager, to manage its components. Below is an example of creating a new Symfony project:

```shell
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton myproject
```

This will download and install a new Symfony project in the 'myproject' directory. Symfony's components are reusable PHP libraries that will help you complete tasks, like routing, templating, or even creating form handling.
