# Zend Debugger

Zend Debugger is a PHP debugging extension used to identify issues in PHP scripts. It allows you to monitor and fix issues in your code, such as logical errors, and helps in boosting your web application's overall performance. Essentially, it becomes a simple yet powerful method for debugging server-side PHP scripts, by providing detailed debugging data and facilitating real-time interaction with the scripts. Using Zend Debugger with PHP can drastically improve the quality of your codebase and save considerable time in the development phase. A short usage example of Zend Debugger can be setting up a debug session, using the function `zend_debugger_connector_address()` which returns the IP address of the debugger currently in use.
