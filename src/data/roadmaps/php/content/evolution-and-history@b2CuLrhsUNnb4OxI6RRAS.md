# Evolution and History

PHP, originally standing for Personal Home Page, is a popular scripting language used commonly for web development. Rasmus Lerdorf created it in 1994, and since then, it has evolved significantly from a simple set of CGI binaries written in C, to a full-featured language. PHP's journey includes several versions, with PHP 3 introducing a re-written parser and a better approach to object-oriented programming. PHP 8.0, introduced several optimizations, JIT compilation, and union types, among other improvements.
