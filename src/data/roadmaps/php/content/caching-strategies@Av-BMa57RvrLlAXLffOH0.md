# Caching Strategies

Caching Strategies are integral to Performance Optimization in PHP. Caching minimizes server load and enhances application speed by temporarily storing results of expensive operations, so that they can be reused in subsequent requests. Some caching techniques used in PHP include opcode caching, object caching, database query caching or full-page caching. For example, OPcache is an opcode caching system that improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in memory, negating the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on every request.
