# LAMP

LAMP refers to the combined use of Linux OS, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL relational database management system, and PHP; it's a popular stack for creating and hosting websites. For PHP, LAMP is a robust, open-source web development platform that supports a wide range of dynamic websites and applications. Suppose you plan to develop a content management system (CMS), forums, or e-commerce shops. In that case, PHP, as a part of the LAMP stack, helps provide a flexible development environment. Here, PHP works hand-in-hand with MySQL to access and manage databases, get queried results, and embed them into HTML pages by the Apache HTTP Server before sending them to the client side.
