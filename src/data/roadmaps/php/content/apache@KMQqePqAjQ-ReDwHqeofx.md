# Apache

Apache is a popular web server that can efficiently host PHP applications. Apache integrates well with PHP, using its `mod_php` module, providing a stable and consistent environment for your PHP scripts to run. This compatibility creates a seamless user experience, as PHP pages are served as if they're part of the website and not just files being executed on the server.
