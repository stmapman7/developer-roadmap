# Profiling Techniques

Profiling is an analytical process within PHP that focuses on optimizing the applicationâ€™s performance. It involves pinpointing bottlenecks and problematic sections of your PHP code that cause poor performance, often using profiling tools. One such tool is Xdebug, which provides detailed information about how each line of code is executed. This process helps in understanding how long an operation takes to execute, which parts consume more memory, and which functions/methods are most frequently used, thereby enabling an optimization strategy. Here's a snippet of how to use Xdebug:

```php
xdebug_start_trace();
// Your code here
xdebug_stop_trace();
```
