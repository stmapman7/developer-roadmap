# Traits

Traits is a concept in PHP that allows code reusability by enabling developers to create reusable pieces of code which can be used in classes to extend functionality. They are a way to reduce intricacies of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes. 

Here's an example how to use a Trait:

```php
trait Greeting {
    public function sayHello() {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
class User {
    use Greeting;
}
$user = new User();
echo $user->sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello
```

In the above code snippet, the `Greeting` trait is being used in the `User` class, and we are able to use its methods as if they were defined in the `User` class.
