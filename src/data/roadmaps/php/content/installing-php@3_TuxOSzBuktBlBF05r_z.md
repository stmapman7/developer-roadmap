# Installing PHP

Installing PHP is an essential process to start developing PHP applications. PHP can be installed on Windows, macOS, and various distributions of Linux. Places to get PHP include the official PHP website, package managers like APT for Linux and Homebrew for macOS, or bundled solutions like XAMPP or WAMP that provide PHP along with a web server and database. After successful installation, you can run a simple PHP script to verify the installation. Here's an example, `<?php echo 'Hello, World!'; ?>`,  which should display "Hello, World!" when accessed in a web browser.
