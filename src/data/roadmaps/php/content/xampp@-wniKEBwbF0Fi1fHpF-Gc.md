# XAMPP

XAMPP is an open-source development environment that stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache server (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P). If you're working with PHP, it's a handy tool because it creates a local web server for testing or development purposes. It's especially useful if you plan to use a database in your project, as it includes MariaDB. It integrates seamlessly with PHP, enabling you to manage your server, scripting language, and database from a unified platform with less hassle. A code sample isn't really applicable here as XAMPP is more about setup and management. For more information, you can visit the official PHP documentation: .
