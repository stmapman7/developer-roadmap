# Database Migrations

Database migrations help keep track of changes in your database schema, making it easier to move from one version of a database to another. Migrations allow us to evolve our database design iteratively and apply these updates across our development, staging, and production servers. This can save a lot of manual work. But more than that, migrations maintain consistency across all the environments, reducing the chances of unexpected behavior. There's no standard built-in migrations mechanism in PHP, but powerful and popular PHP frameworks like Laravel have robust solutions for migrations.
