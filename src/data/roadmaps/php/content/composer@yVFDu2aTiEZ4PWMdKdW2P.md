# Composer

Composer is a fundamental tool in modern PHP development. It simplifies the management of project dependencies, allowing you to declare what you need and automatically installing those resources in your project. For example, if your PHP project requires a certain library, Composer will fetch the appropriate version and make sure it's available for your project. Here's an example of how to add a dependency using Composer:

```shell
composer require vendor/package
```

This command adds the `vendor/package` dependency to your project. The same goes for removing dependencies, updating them, and more.
