# print

The 'print' statement in PHP is an in-built function used for outputting one or more strings. Unlike 'echo', it is not a language construct and has a return value. However, it is slower because it uses expressions. The text or numeric data that 'print' outputs can be shown directly or stored in a variable. For instance, to print a string you may use `print("Hello, World!");`, and for using it with a variable, `echo $variable;` is suitable.
