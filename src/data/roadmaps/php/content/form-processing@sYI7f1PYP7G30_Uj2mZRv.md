# Form Processing

Form processing is a common web function and in PHP, it's pretty straightforward. It typically involves accepting data from a user through a web form and then using PHP to handle, process and possibly store that data. PHP provides superglobal arrays (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_REQUEST`) which help to collect form data. Let's talk about a simple example of a form that accepts a name from a user and then displays it.

Make sure to handle form data securely, for instance by using the `htmlspecialchars()` function to neutralize any harmful characters.
