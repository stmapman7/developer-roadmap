# Data Types

PHP is a flexible and widely-used language that supports several types of data. These types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, arrays, objects, NULL, and many more. The different data types allow developers to efficiently manage and handle data in their applications. For example, an integer data type in PHP can be a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. Here's a small sample PHP code snippet that assigns different data types to variables: 

```php
$text = "Hello world!";  // String
$number = 1234;  // Integer
$decimalNumber = 12.34;  // Floating-point number
$boolean = true; // Boolean
```
