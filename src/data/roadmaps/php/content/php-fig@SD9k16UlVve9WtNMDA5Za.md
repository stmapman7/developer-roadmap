# PHP-FIG

PHP-FIG, also known as the PHP Framework Interoperability Group, is a vital part of PHP's ecosystem. This group has the main goal of creating PHP standards that promote interoperability among PHP frameworks, libraries, and other pieces of PHP based software. The group is responsible for PSR standards, which most modern PHP codes adhere to. Typically, it provides guidelines on coding style, logger interface, http cache, and more. Each PSR is designed to make PHP code more consistent and maintainable. By adhering to PHP-FIG's standards, developers enhance their ability to integrate and leverage third-party code within their projects.
