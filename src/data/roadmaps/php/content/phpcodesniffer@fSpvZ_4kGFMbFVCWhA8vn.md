# PHPCodeSniffer

PHPCodeSniffer, often abbreviated as PHPCS, is a fantastic tool designed for PHP developers to maintain neat and consistent coding styles across their projects. It does this by analyzing the PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files in your project to detect deviations from a defined set of coding standards. When PHPCodeSniffer finds a violation, it flags it for fixing, thus making your codebase more readable and harmonious. Here is an example of running PHPCS:

```shell
phpcs --standard=PSR2 /path/to/your/phpfile.php 
```

This command checks your PHP file against the PSR-2 coding standard.
