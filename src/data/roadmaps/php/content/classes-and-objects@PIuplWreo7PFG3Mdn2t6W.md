# Classes and Objects

PHP supports object-oriented programming, offering a multi-paradigm way of coding through classes and objects. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate all faculties, properties and methods. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class where you can interact with the class's methods and change its properties. PHP lets you define a class using the keyword 'class', set properties and methods within it, and then create an object of that class using 'new'.
