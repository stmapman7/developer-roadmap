# CSV Processing

CSV processing refers to handling CSV (Comma Separated Values) files in PHP, an operation significantly useful for managing tabular data. PHP provides a few key functions to handle CSV files effectively. For example, `fgetcsv()` allows you to read CSV file line by line, `fputcsv()` lets you write line by line into a CSV file, and `str_getcsv()` allows you to parse a CSV string into an array. A quick example of reading a CSV file:

```php
if (($handle = fopen("sample.csv", "r")) !== FALSE) {
    while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ",")) !== FALSE) {
        print_r($data);
    }
    fclose($handle);
}
```

In this snippet, PHP reads through each line of the `sample.csv` file, converting each into an array with `fgetcsv()`.
