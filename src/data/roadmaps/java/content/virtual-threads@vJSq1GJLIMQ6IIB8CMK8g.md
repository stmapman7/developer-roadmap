# Virtual Threads

Virtual Threads are lightweight threads managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Unlike traditional operating system threads, which are relatively expensive to create and manage, virtual threads are designed to be extremely lightweight, allowing for the creation of millions of them. They are intended to improve the scalability and concurrency of Java applications by making it easier to write code that can handle a large number of concurrent operations without the overhead associated with traditional threads.
