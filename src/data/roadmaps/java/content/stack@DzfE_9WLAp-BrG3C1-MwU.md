# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates; you can only add or remove plates from the top. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used to manage function calls, evaluate expressions, and implement undo/redo functionality.
