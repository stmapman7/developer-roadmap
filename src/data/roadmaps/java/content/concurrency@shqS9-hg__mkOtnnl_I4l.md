# Concurrency

Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously. This doesn't necessarily mean they are running at the exact same instant, but rather that their execution overlaps in time. This can be achieved through techniques like multithreading, where a single program is divided into multiple threads that can run concurrently, or through asynchronous programming, where tasks can be started and then the program can continue executing other tasks without waiting for the first task to complete.
