# Record

A record is a special type of class in Java that is designed to hold immutable data. It automatically generates methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on the components declared in its header, reducing boilerplate code. Records are useful for creating data transfer objects (DTOs) or simple data aggregates where the primary purpose is to store and access data.
