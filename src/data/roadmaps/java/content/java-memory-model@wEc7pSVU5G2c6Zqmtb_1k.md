# Java Memory Model

The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads in Java interact with memory. It specifies how and when different threads can see writes to shared variables, addressing issues like data visibility and race conditions in concurrent programs. The JMM ensures that multithreaded Java programs behave predictably across different hardware architectures by establishing rules for memory synchronization and ordering.
