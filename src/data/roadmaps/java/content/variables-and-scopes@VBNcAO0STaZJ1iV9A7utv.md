# Variables and Scopes

Variables are like containers that hold data in a program. Each variable has a name, a type (like integer, text, or boolean), and a value. The scope of a variable determines where in your code you can access and use that variable. Understanding scope is crucial to avoid naming conflicts and ensure data is accessed correctly within different parts of your program.
