# Strings and Methods

Strings are sequences of characters, like words or sentences, used to represent text in programming. Methods are actions you can perform on these strings, such as finding their length, changing their case (uppercase or lowercase), or extracting parts of them. These methods allow you to manipulate and work with text data effectively.
