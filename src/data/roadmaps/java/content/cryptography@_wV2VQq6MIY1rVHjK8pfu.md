# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It involves converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) through encryption, and then converting the ciphertext back into plaintext through decryption. Cryptography uses algorithms and keys to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of information.
