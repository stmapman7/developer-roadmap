# Interfaces

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It specifies a set of methods that a class must implement if it claims to implement the interface. Think of it as a contract: any class that "signs" the contract (implements the interface) agrees to provide specific behaviors (methods). Interfaces can also contain constants (static final variables). They help achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
