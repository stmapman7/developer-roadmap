# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them themselves. This means a class doesn't have to worry about how to obtain the objects it needs to function; instead, those objects are "injected" into the class, usually through its constructor, setter methods, or interface. This promotes loose coupling and makes code more testable and maintainable.
