# Optionals

Optionals are a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. They are primarily used to represent the absence of a value, avoiding the need to return null, which can lead to NullPointerExceptions. Optionals provide methods to explicitly check if a value is present and to handle cases where a value is absent in a more controlled and readable manner.
