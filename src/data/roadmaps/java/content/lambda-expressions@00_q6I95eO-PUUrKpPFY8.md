# Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are essentially short blocks of code that you can pass around to be executed. They allow you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Think of them as anonymous methods – methods without a name – that can be written directly in the place where they are needed, making your code more concise and readable, especially when dealing with functional interfaces.
