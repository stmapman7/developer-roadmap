# Array vs ArrayList

Arrays and ArrayLists are both ways to store collections of elements in Java. An array is a fixed-size, ordered sequence of elements of the same data type. Once you declare its size, you cannot change it. An ArrayList, on the other hand, is a dynamic, resizable array implementation. It can grow or shrink as needed, allowing you to add or remove elements without worrying about the initial size.
