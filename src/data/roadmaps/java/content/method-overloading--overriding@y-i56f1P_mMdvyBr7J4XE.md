# Method Overloading and Overriding

Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number, types, or order of parameters). Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method signature (name and parameters) must be the same in both the superclass and the subclass for overriding to occur.
