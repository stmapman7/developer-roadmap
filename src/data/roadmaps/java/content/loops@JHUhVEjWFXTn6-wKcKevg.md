# Loops

In Java and other programming languages, loops are used to iterate a part of the program several times. There are four types of loops in Java, `for`, `forEach`, `while`, and `do...while`.

- Syntax of `for` loop is `for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){}`
- Syntax of `forEach` loop is `for(data_type variable:array_name){}`
