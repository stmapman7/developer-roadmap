# Pass by Value / Pass by Reference

Pass by value and pass by reference are two different ways of passing arguments to a function or method. In pass by value, a copy of the variable's value is passed to the function, so any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable. In pass by reference, a direct reference to the variable is passed, meaning that changes made to the parameter inside the function will directly affect the original variable.
