# Basics of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around "objects," which contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). OOP focuses on creating reusable code by grouping related data and behavior into objects, allowing for modularity, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts help in organizing and structuring code in a way that mirrors real-world entities and their interactions.
