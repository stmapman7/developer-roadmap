# Annotations

Annotations are a form of metadata that provide data about a program. They are used to provide supplemental information about the code, but they are not a part of the program itself. Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings, and they can also be used at runtime to modify the behavior of the program.
