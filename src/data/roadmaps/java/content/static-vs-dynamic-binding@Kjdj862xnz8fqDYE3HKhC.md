# Static vs Dynamic Binding

Static binding, also known as early binding, happens at compile time. The compiler knows exactly which method will be called based on the type of the variable. Dynamic binding, or late binding, occurs at runtime. The specific method to be called is determined based on the actual object type, not the variable type, allowing for more flexibility and polymorphism.
