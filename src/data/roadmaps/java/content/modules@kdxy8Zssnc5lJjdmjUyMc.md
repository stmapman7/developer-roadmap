# Modules

Modules in Java are a way to organize code into reusable and independent units. They provide a higher level of abstraction than packages, allowing you to control which parts of your code are exposed to other modules and which are kept private. This enhances encapsulation, improves security, and simplifies dependency management by explicitly declaring dependencies between modules.
