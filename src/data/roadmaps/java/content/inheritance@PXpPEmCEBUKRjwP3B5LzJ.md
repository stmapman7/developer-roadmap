# Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (called a subclass or derived class) acquires properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting a more organized and maintainable codebase. The subclass can extend the superclass by adding new attributes and methods or overriding existing ones.
