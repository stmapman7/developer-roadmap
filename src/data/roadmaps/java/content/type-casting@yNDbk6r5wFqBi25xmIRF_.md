# Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations between variables of different types, or when you need to store a value of one type in a variable of another type. In Java, type casting can be either implicit (automatic) or explicit (requiring a cast operator).
