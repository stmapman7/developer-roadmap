# Bazel

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms. It's designed for fast, reliable, and reproducible builds, making it suitable for large codebases and complex projects.
