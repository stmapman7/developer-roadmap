# Map

A Map is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value. Think of it like a dictionary where you use a word (the key) to look up its definition (the value). Maps allow you to efficiently retrieve, add, or remove values based on their associated keys.
