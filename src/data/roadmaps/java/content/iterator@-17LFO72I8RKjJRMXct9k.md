# Iterator

An Iterator is an object that enables you to traverse through a collection (like a List or Set) one element at a time. It provides a standard way to access elements sequentially without needing to know the underlying structure of the collection. You can use methods like `hasNext()` to check if there's a next element and `next()` to retrieve it.
