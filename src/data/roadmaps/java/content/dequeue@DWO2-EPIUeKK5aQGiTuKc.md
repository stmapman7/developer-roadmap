# Dequeue

A Dequeue (pronounced "dee-queue") is a double-ended queue, a data structure that allows you to add and remove elements from both the front (head) and the back (tail) of the queue. Unlike a regular queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out), a dequeue provides flexibility for both FIFO and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) operations. This makes it useful for implementing various algorithms and data management tasks where elements need to be accessed or modified from either end.
