# git commit --amend

`git commit --amend` is a command used to modify the most recent commit in your repository's history by updating its message, adding or removing files, or changing the commit's metadata. This allows you to correct mistakes or improve the commit's description after it has been made. When using --amend, Git will replace the existing commit with a new one that includes any changes made since the last commit, effectively "amending" the previous commit.
