# What are these?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. It allows developers to create custom workflows that automatically build, test, and deploy their code directly from their GitHub repositories. These workflows are triggered by specific events, such as push requests, pull requests, or scheduled tasks. GitHub Actions enables teams to streamline their development processes, improve code quality, and accelerate software delivery by automating repetitive tasks and integrating various tools and services seamlessly within their development pipeline.
