# Git Attributes

Git attributes are settings stored in the .gitattributes file, controlling how Git handles files in your repository. They can influence filtering (e.g., ignoring specific files), conversion (formatting or transforming files during Git operations), and formatting (applying consistent styles). These settings can be applied to specific file types (like *.txt) or filter files based on content patterns. Attributes also define smudge patterns (highlighting differences) and ignore patterns, helping maintain a clean repository by automatically applying intended settings for certain file types.
