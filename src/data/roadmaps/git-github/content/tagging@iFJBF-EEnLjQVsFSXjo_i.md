# Tagging

In Git, tags are used to identify specific points in a repository's history as being important. This feature allows developers to mark release points or milestones.

- Marking release points: Tags are typically used to mark release versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0) of a project.
- Types of tags: There are different types of tags, including lightweight and annotated tags.
