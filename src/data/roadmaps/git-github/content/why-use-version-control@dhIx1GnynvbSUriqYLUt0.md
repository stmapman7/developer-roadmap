# Why use Version Control?

Using version control is essential for managing changes in software development, as it enables tracking of modifications, collaboration, and maintaining a history of your project. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's work, providing a clear record of who made changes and why. Version control systems facilitate rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and they support branching and merging, which are crucial for experimenting with new features and managing different stages of development. Overall, version control ensures code quality, accountability, and efficient collaboration in projects.
