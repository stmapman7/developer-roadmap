# OAuth Apps

GitHub OAuth Apps allow developers to integrate with GitHub using OAuth 2.0 authentication. They enable secure, token-based access to specific GitHub resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. OAuth Apps can automate tasks, personalize interactions, and provide real-time notifications through webhooks, all while allowing users to approve only the necessary permissions without sharing their credentials.
