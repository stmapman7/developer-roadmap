# Git Patch

In Git, a patch is a file that contains a set of changes made to a project's codebase. It's essentially a diff (difference) file that shows the modifications between two versions of a commit or a branch. However, despite its usefulness in certain contexts, the use of Git patches has declined somewhat with the advent of more modern and efficient ways to manage code changes.
