The iOS Media Layer is a collection of frameworks and technologies that enable developers to incorporate rich multimedia experiences into their apps. It includes tools for handling audio, video, and graphics. Key components are AVFoundation for working with time-based audiovisual media, Core Audio for low-level audio processing, Core Animation for fluid animations and visual effects, and Metal for high-performance graphics rendering. This layer also provides support for camera operations, audio recording, and media playback.
