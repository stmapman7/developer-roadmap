# View Transitions

UIKit View Transitions provide mechanisms for animating changes between different views or view states within an iOS app. These transitions can be used for presenting or dismissing view controllers, switching between views in a container, or updating the content of a single view. UIKit offers built-in transition styles like push, fade, and flip, as well as the ability to create custom transitions using animation controllers. Developers can use `UIView.transition(with:duration:options:animations:completion:)` for simple view changes or implement `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` for more complex, custom transitions between view controllers.
