# View Controllers

UIKit View Controllers are central to iOS app architecture, managing a view hierarchy and coordinating the flow of data between the app's data model and its views. They handle the presentation and dismissal of content, respond to user interactions, and manage the lifecycle of their associated views. Key types include `UIViewController` for basic screen management, `UINavigationController` for hierarchical navigation, `UITabBarController` for tab-based interfaces, and `UITableViewController` for table-based content. View controllers are responsible for loading and unloading views, handling device rotation, and managing memory efficiently.
