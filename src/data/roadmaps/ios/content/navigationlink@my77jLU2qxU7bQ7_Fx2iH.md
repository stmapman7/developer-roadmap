# NavigationLink

NavigationLink is a SwiftUI component used to create navigation hierarchies within an app. It enables developers to define navigation paths between views, typically within a NavigationView. When tapped, a NavigationLink pushes a new view onto the navigation stack. It can be configured with a destination view and optional label, allowing for customizable navigation buttons or entire rows in lists to become navigable. NavigationLink supports programmatic navigation through bindings, enabling dynamic navigation based on app state.
