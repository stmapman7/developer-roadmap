# Version Control

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. It enables users to review project history, revert to previous states, manage different versions, and merge changes from multiple sources. Git is the most popular version control system, offering features like branching, merging, and distributed development. Version control is essential for software development, providing backup, facilitating collaboration, and allowing experimentation without risking project stability. It helps teams maintain code quality, resolve conflicts, and streamline the development process across various platforms and projects.
