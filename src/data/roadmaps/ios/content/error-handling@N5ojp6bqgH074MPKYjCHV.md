# Error Handling

Error handling is a crucial programming concept for managing unexpected situations or failures during code execution. It involves anticipating potential issues, detecting when they occur, and responding appropriately. Common techniques include try-catch blocks, throwing and catching exceptions, and using error codes or result objects. Effective error handling improves program robustness, prevents crashes, aids in debugging, and enhances user experience by providing meaningful feedback. It allows developers to gracefully manage issues like invalid inputs, resource unavailability, or network failures, ensuring the program can recover or fail safely when problems arise.
