# ViewController Lifecycle

The ViewController lifecycle in iOS refers to the sequence of methods called as a view controller transitions between states. It begins with initialization, followed by loading the view, appearing on screen, disappearing, and potentially being deallocated. Key methods include `viewDidLoad()`, `viewWillAppear()`, `viewDidAppear()`, `viewWillDisappear()`, and `viewDidDisappear()`. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for managing resources, updating UI, and handling state changes efficiently in iOS apps.
