# User Interactions

UIKit User Interactions encompass the various ways users can engage with an iOS app's interface. This includes touch events (taps, swipes, pinches), gesture recognizers for complex interactions, and control events for UI elements like buttons and sliders. UIKit provides a robust event handling system, allowing developers to respond to user actions through target-action patterns, delegate methods, or closure-based callbacks. It also supports accessibility features, enabling interactions via VoiceOver and switch control.
