# async / await in Swift

Async/await in Swift is a modern concurrency model introduced in Swift 5.5 that simplifies asynchronous programming. It allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, improving readability and reducing callback hell. The `async` keyword marks functions that can be suspended and resumed, while `await` is used to call these functions and wait for their completion. This model works with Swift's structured concurrency system, including tasks and actors, to manage complex asynchronous operations more easily.
