# Components

UIKit components are the building blocks of iOS user interfaces, offering a wide range of pre-designed elements for creating functional and visually appealing apps. These include basic controls like `UIButton`, `UILabel`, and `UITextField` for user input and display; container views such as `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` for organizing content; `UINavigationController` and `UITabBarController` for app navigation; and `UIAlertController` for displaying alerts and action sheets. UIKit also provides components for more specialized functions, like `UIImageView` for displaying images, `UIScrollView` for scrollable content, and `UIPickerView` for selection interfaces.
