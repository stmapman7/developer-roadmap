# Views

UIKit views are the core visual elements in iOS interfaces, serving as the canvas for all user interface components. At its most basic, a view is an instance of UIView, representing a rectangular area on the screen. Views handle rendering content, laying out subviews, and responding to touch events. They can be nested to create complex layouts, with each view responsible for drawing and managing its own area. While some views display content directly, others act as containers for other views.
