# UIKit

UIKit is a fundamental framework for building user interfaces in iOS applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and pre-built components for creating and managing graphical interfaces, handling user interactions, and implementing app navigation. UIKit includes essential UI elements like buttons, labels, text fields, and table views, as well as controllers for managing view hierarchies and app structure. It also offers support for touch and gesture recognition, animation, and accessibility features. While SwiftUI is gaining popularity, UIKit remains crucial for iOS development due to its maturity, extensive documentation, and wide range of capabilities for creating polished, responsive user interfaces across Apple's mobile platforms.
