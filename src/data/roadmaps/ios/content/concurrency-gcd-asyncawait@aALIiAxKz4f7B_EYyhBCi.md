# Concurrency (GCD, async/await)

Concurrency in iOS development refers to executing multiple tasks simultaneously, improving app performance and responsiveness. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a low-level API that manages concurrent operations through queues, while async/await is a modern Swift feature that simplifies asynchronous code. These tools allow developers to perform time-consuming tasks (like network requests or complex calculations) in the background without freezing the UI. By leveraging concurrency, iOS apps can efficiently utilize device resources, handle multiple operations simultaneously, and maintain a smooth user experience even during intensive processing tasks.

iOS specific concurrency is covered later in the roadmap.
