# Data Privacy + PII Redaction

AI agents often process text, images, and logs that include personal data like names, phone numbers, or addresses. Leaks can cause fraud, stalking, or other harm, so laws like GDPR and CCPA require strict protections. A key method is PII redaction: scanning inputs and outputs to find and mask any personal details before storage or sharing. Redaction uses pattern rules, machine learning, or both. Teams should also keep audit logs, enforce access controls, and test their redaction flows often to prevent leaks.
