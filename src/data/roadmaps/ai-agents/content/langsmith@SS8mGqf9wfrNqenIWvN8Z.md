# LangSmith

LangSmith is a web tool that helps you see and fix what your AI agents are doing. It records each call that the agent makes to a language model, the input it used, and the answer it got back. You can replay any step, compare different prompts, measure cost, speed, and error rates, and tag runs for easy search. It also lets you store test sets and run quick checks so you know if new code makes the agent worse. By showing clear traces and charts, LangSmith makes it easier to debug, improve, and trust AI systems built with LangChain or other frameworks.
