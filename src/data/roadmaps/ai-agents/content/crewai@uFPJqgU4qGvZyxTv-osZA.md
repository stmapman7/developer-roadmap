# CrewAI

CrewAI is an open-source Python framework for creating teams of AI agents, called a crew. Each agent is assigned a name, role, and set of tools, and the system manages planning, communication, and execution between them. To use it, install the package, define agents in code, connect them with a `Crew` object, and assign a mission prompt. CrewAI interacts with an LLM like GPT-4 or Claude, passes messages, runs tools, and returns a final output. You can also add web search, custom functions, or memory stores. Logs are built-in to help debug and optimize workflows.
