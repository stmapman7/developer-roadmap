# AutoGen

AutoGen is an open-source Python framework that helps you build AI agents without starting from scratch. It lets you define each agent with a role, goals, and tools, then handles the chat flow between them and a large language model such as GPT-4. You can chain several agents so they plan, code, review, and run tasks together. The library includes ready-made modules for memory, task planning, tool calling, and function execution, so you only write the parts that are unique to your app. AutoGen connects to OpenAI, Azure, or local models through a simple settings file. Logs, cost tracking, and step-by-step debugging come built in, which makes testing easy. Because the agents are plain Python objects, you can mix them with other libraries or your own code. AutoGen is still young, so expect fast changes and keep an eye on usage costs, but it is a strong choice when you want to turn a prompt into a working multi-agent system in hours instead of weeks.
