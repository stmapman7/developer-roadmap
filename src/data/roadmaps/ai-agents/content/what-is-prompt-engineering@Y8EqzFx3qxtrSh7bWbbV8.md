# What is Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear questions or instructions so that an AI system gives the answer you want. It means choosing the right words, adding enough detail, and giving examples when needed. A good prompt tells the AI what role to play, what style to use, and what facts to include or avoid. By testing and refining the prompt, you can improve the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the AIâ€™s response. In short, prompt engineering is guiding the AI with well-designed text so it can help you better.
