# Long Term Memory

Long term memory in an AI agent stores important information for future use, like a digital notebook. It saves facts, past events, user preferences, and learned skills so the agent can make smarter and more consistent decisions over time. Unlike short-term memory, this data survives across sessions. When a similar situation comes up, the agent can look back and use what it already knows. Long term memory usually lives in a database, file system, or vector store and may hold text, numbers, embeddings, or past conversation states. Good management of long-term memory is key for building agents that feel personalized and get better with experience.
