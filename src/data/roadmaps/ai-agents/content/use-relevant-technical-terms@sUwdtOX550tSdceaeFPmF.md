# Use relevant technical terms

When a task involves a special field such as law, medicine, or computer science, include the correct domain words in your prompt so the AI knows exactly what you mean. Ask for “O(n log n) sorting algorithms” instead of just “fast sorts,” or “HTTP status code 404” instead of “page not found error.” The right term narrows the topic, removes guesswork, and points the model toward the knowledge base you need. It also keeps the answer at the right level, because the model sees you understand the field and will reply with matching depth. Check spelling and letter case; “SQL” and “sql” are seen the same, but “Sequel” is not. Do not overload the prompt with buzzwords—add only the words that truly matter. The goal is clear language plus the exact technical labels the subject uses.
