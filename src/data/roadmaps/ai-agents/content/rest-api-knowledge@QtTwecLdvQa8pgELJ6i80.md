# REST API Knowledge

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In AI agents, REST APIs enable communication between the agent and external systems, allowing for data exchange and integration. The agent can use REST APIs to retrieve data from external sources, send data to external systems, and interact with other AI agents or services. This provides a flexible and scalable way to integrate with various systems, enabling the agent to access a wide range of data and services. REST APIs in AI agents support a variety of functions, including data retrieval, data sending, and system interaction. They play a crucial role in facilitating communication between AI agents and external systems, making them a fundamental component of AI agent architecture.
