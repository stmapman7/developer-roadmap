# Git and Terminal Usage

Git and the terminal are key tools for AI agents and developers. Git lets you track changes in code, work with branches, and collaborate safely with others. It stores snapshots of your work so you can undo mistakes or merge ideas. The terminal (command line) lets you move around files, run programs, set up servers, and control tools like Git quickly without a GUI.
