# Metrics to Track

To judge how well an AI agent works, you need clear numbers. Track accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure correctness. For ranking tasks, use metrics like mean average precision or ROC-AUC. If users interact with the agent, monitor response time, latency, and failure rates. Safety metrics count toxic or biased outputs, while robustness tests check how the agent handles messy or tricky inputs. Resource metrics—memory, CPU, and energy—show if it can scale. Pick the metrics that match your goal, compare against a baseline, and track trends across versions.
