# DeepEval

DeepEval is an open-source tool that helps you test and score the answers your AI agent gives. You write small test cases that show an input and the reply you hope to get, or a rule the reply must follow. DeepEval runs the agent, checks the reply with built-in measures such as similarity, accuracy, or safety, and then marks each test as pass or fail. You can add your own checks, store tests in code or YAML files, and run them in a CI pipeline so every new model or prompt version gets the same quick audit. The fast feedback makes it easy to spot errors, cut down on hallucinations, and compare different models before you ship.
