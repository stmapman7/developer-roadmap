# Web Search

Web search lets an AI agent pull fresh facts, news, and examples from the internet while it is working. The agent turns a user request into search words, sends them to a search engine, and reads the list of results. It then follows the most promising links, grabs the page text, and picks out the parts that answer the task. This helps the agent handle topics that were not in its training data, update old knowledge, or double-check details. Web search covers almost any subject and is much faster than manual research, but the agent must watch for ads, bias, or wrong pages and cross-check sources to stay accurate.
