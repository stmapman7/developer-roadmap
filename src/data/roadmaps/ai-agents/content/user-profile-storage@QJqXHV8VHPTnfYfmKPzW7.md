# User Profile Storage

User profile storage is the part of an AI agentâ€™s memory that holds stable facts about each user, such as name, age group, language, past choices, and long-term goals. The agent saves this data in a file or small database so it can load it each time the same user returns. By keeping the profile separate from short-term conversation logs, the agent can remember preferences without mixing them with temporary chat history. The profile is updated only when the user states a new lasting preference or when old information changes, which helps prevent drift or bloat.
