# Tree-of-Thought

Tree-of-Thought is a way to organize an AI agentâ€™s reasoning as a branching tree. At the root, the agent states the main problem. Each branch is a small idea, step, or guess that could lead to a solution. The agent expands the most promising branches, checks if they make sense, and prunes paths that look wrong or unhelpful. This setup helps the agent explore many possible answers while staying focused on the best ones. Because the agent can compare different branches side by side, it is less likely to get stuck on a bad line of thought. The result is more reliable and creative problem solving.
