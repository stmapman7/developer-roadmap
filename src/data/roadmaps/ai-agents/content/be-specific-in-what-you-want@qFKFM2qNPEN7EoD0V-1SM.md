# Be specific in what you want

When you ask an AI to do something, clear and exact words help it give the answer you want. State the goal, the format, and any limits up front. Say who the answer is for, how long it should be, and what to leave out. If numbers, dates, or sources matter, name them. For example, rather than “Explain World War II,” try “List three key events of World War II with dates and one short fact for each.” Being this precise cuts down on guesswork, avoids unwanted extra detail, and saves time by reducing follow-up questions.
