# Data Analysis

AI agents can automate data analysis by pulling information from files, databases, or live streams. They clean the data by spotting missing values, outliers, and making smart corrections. After cleaning, agents find patterns like sales spikes or sensor drops and can build charts or dashboards. Some run basic statistics, others apply machine learning to predict trends. Agents can also send alerts if numbers go beyond set limits, helping people stay informed without constant monitoring.
