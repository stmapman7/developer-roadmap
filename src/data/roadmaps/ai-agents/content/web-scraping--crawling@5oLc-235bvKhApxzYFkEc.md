# Web Scraping / Crawling

Web scraping and crawling let an AI agent collect data from many web pages without human help. The agent sends a request to a page, reads the HTML, and pulls out parts you ask for, such as prices, news headlines, or product details. It can then follow links on the page to reach more pages and repeat the same steps. This loop builds a large, up-to-date dataset in minutes or hours instead of days. Companies use it to track market prices, researchers use it to gather facts or trends, and developers use it to feed fresh data into other AI models. Good scraping code also respects site rules like robots.txt and avoids hitting servers too fast, so it works smoothly and fairly.
