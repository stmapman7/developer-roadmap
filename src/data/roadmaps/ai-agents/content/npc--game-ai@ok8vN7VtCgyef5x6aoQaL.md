# NPC / Game AI

Game studios use AI agents to control non-player characters (NPCs). The agent observes the game state and decides actions like moving, speaking, or fighting. It can shift tactics when the player changes strategy, keeping battles fresh instead of predictable. A quest giver might use an agent to offer hints that fit the player’s progress. In open-world games, agents guide crowds to move around obstacles, set new goals, and react to threats, making towns feel alive. Designers save time by writing broad rules and letting agents fill in details instead of hand-coding every scene. Smarter NPC behavior keeps players engaged and boosts replay value.
