# Manual (from scratch)

Building an AI agent from scratch means writing every part of the system yourself, without ready-made libraries. You define how the agent senses inputs, stores memory, makes decisions, and learns over time. First, you pick a clear goal, like solving puzzles or chatting. Then you code the inputs (keyboard, mouse, text), decision logic (rules or neural networks), and memory (saving facts from past events). Testing is critical: you run the agent, watch its actions, debug, and improve. Though it takes longer, this approach gives deep understanding and full control over how the agent works and evolves.
