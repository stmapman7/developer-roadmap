# MCP Servers

An MCP Server is the main machine or cloud service that runs the Model Context Protocol. It keeps the shared “memory” that different AI agents need so they stay on the same page. When an agent sends a request, the server checks who is asking, pulls the right context from its store, and sends it back fast. It also saves new facts and task results so the next agent can use them. An MCP Server must handle many users at once, protect private data with strict access rules, and log every change for easy roll-back. Good servers break work into small tasks, spread them across many computers, and add backups so they never lose data. In short, the MCP Server is the hub that makes sure all agents share fresh, safe, and correct context.
