# Creating MCP Servers

An MCP server stores and shares conversation data for AI agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard for agent memory management. Start by picking a language and web framework, then create REST endpoints like `/messages`, `/state`, and `/health`. Each endpoint exchanges JSON following the MCP schema. Store session logs with a session ID, role, and timestamp using a database or in-memory store. Add token-based authentication and filters so agents can fetch only what they need. Set limits on message size and request rates to avoid overload. Finally, write unit tests, add monitoring, and run load tests to ensure stability.
