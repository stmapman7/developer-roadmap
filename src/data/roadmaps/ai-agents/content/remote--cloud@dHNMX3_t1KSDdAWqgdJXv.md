# Remote / Cloud

Remote or cloud deployment places the MCP server on a cloud provider instead of a local machine. You package the server as a container or virtual machine, choose a service like AWS, Azure, or GCP, and give it compute, storage, and a public HTTPS address. A load balancer spreads traffic, while auto-scaling adds or removes copies of the server as demand changes. You secure the endpoint with TLS, API keys, and firewalls, and you send logs and metrics to the providerâ€™s monitoring tools. This setup lets the server handle many users, updates are easier, and you avoid local hardware limits, though you must watch costs and protect sensitive data.
