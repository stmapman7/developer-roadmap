# Integration Testing for Flows

Integration testing for flows checks that an AI agent works well from the first user input to the final action, across every step in between. It joins all parts of the system—natural-language understanding, planning, memory, tools, and output—and runs them together in real scenarios. Test cases follow common and edge-case paths a user might take. The goal is to catch errors that only appear when parts interact, such as wrong data passed between modules or timing issues. Good practice includes building automated test suites, using real or mock services, and logging each step for easy debugging. When integration tests pass, you gain confidence that the whole flow feels smooth and reliable for users.
