# Database Queries

Database queries let an AI agent fetch, add, change, or remove data stored in a database. The agent sends a request written in a query language, most often SQL. The database engine then looks through its tables and returns only the rows and columns that match the rules in the request. With this tool, the agent can answer questions that need up-to-date numbers, user records, or other stored facts. It can also write new entries or adjust old ones to keep the data current. Because queries work in real time and follow clear rules, they give the agent a reliable way to handle large sets of structured information.
