# Local Desktop

A Local Desktop deployment means running the MCP server directly on your own computer instead of a remote cloud or server. You install the MCP software, needed runtimes, and model files onto your desktop or laptop. The server then listens on a local address like `127.0.0.1:8000`, accessible only from the same machine unless you open ports manually. This setup is great for fast tests, personal demos, or private experiments since you keep full control and avoid cloud costs. However, it's limited by your hardware's speed and memory, and others cannot access it without tunneling tools like ngrok or local port forwarding.
