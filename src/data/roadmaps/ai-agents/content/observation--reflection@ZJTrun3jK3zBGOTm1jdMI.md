# Observation & Reflection

Observation and reflection form the thinking pause in an AI agent’s loop. First, the agent looks at the world around it, gathers fresh data, and sees what has changed. It then pauses to ask, “What does this new information mean for my goal?” During this short check, the agent updates its memory, spots errors, and ranks what matters most. These steps guide wiser plans and actions in the next cycle. Without careful observation and reflection, the agent would rely on old or wrong facts and soon drift off course.
