# Human in the Loop Evaluation

Human-in-the-loop evaluation checks an AI agent by letting real people judge its output and behavior. Instead of trusting only automated scores, testers invite users, domain experts, or crowd workers to watch tasks, label answers, flag errors, and rate clarity, fairness, or safety. Their feedback shows problems that numbers alone miss, such as hidden bias, confusing language, or actions that feel wrong to a person. Teams study these notes, adjust the model, and run another round, repeating until the agent meets quality and trust goals. Mixing human judgment with data leads to a system that is more accurate, useful, and safe for everyday use.
