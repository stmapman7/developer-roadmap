# DAG Agents

A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) agent is made of small parts called nodes that form a one-way graph with no loops. Each node does a task and passes its result to the next. Because there are no cycles, data always moves forward, making workflows easy to follow and debug. Independent nodes can run in parallel, speeding up tasks. If a node fails, you can trace and fix that part without touching the rest. DAG agents are ideal for jobs like data cleaning, multi-step reasoning, or workflows where backtracking isnâ€™t needed.
