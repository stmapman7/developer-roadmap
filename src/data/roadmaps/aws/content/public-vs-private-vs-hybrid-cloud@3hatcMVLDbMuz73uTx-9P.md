# Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers various cloud-based deployment models to cater to varying business needs, including Public, Private, and Hybrid clouds. A **Public Cloud** is a model where the service provider offers resources, such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet. Resources may be free, or sold on a pay-per-usage model. On the other hand, a **Private Cloud** is a type of cloud computing that delivers similar advantages to public cloud, including scalability and self-service, but through a proprietary architecture dedicated to a single organization. Unlike public clouds, which deliver services to multiple organizations, a private cloud is dedicated to the needs and goals of a single entity. Lastly, a **Hybrid Cloud** is a solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service.
