# Semaphores

**Semaphores** are crucial synchronization mechanisms in server-side game development, ensuring controlled access to shared resources and 
preventing race conditions. They are widely used for managing concurrent processes, such as limiting the number of active players in a 
session, regulating access to database connections, and synchronizing threads in physics or AI computations. By using semaphores, 
developers can optimize performance by preventing resource starvation and contention. Implementing them correctly requires careful 
handling to avoid deadlocks and ensure efficient thread scheduling. Commonly used in conjunction with mutexes and condition variables, 
semaphores help maintain stability in high-performance multiplayer environments.
