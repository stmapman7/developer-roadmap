# Coroutine  

**Coroutines** are lightweight, cooperative multitasking constructs that enable efficient asynchronous programming in server-side game 
development. Unlike traditional threads, coroutines allow functions to be paused and resumed without blocking the entire execution 
thread, making them ideal for handling game logic, networking, and AI behavior with minimal overhead. They work seamlessly with 
future & promise mechanisms, simplifying concurrency management by avoiding callback hell and reducing synchronization complexity. 
Coroutines are widely supported in modern languages like C++ (via `std::coroutine`), Python (`asyncio`), and Kotlin, offering game 
developers an efficient way to write non-blocking code while maintaining readability and performance.
