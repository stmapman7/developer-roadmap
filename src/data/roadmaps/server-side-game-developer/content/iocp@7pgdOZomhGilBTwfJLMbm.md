# IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)  

**I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)** is a high-performance asynchronous I/O mechanism in Windows, 
designed to efficiently handle large numbers of concurrent network connections. It is widely 
used in server-side game development to optimize networking performance, making it ideal for 
MMORPGs and real-time multiplayer games. Unlike `select` or `WSA-Poll`, IOCP uses a thread 
pool and a queue-based event system to process completed I/O operations asynchronously, 
minimizing CPU overhead and improving scalability. By leveraging IOCP, game servers can 
efficiently handle thousands of connections with minimal latency, making it the preferred 
choice for high-performance Windows-based game networking.
