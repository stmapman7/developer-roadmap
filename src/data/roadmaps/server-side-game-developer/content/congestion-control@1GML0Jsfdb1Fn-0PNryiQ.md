# Congestion Control  

**Congestion control** is a fundamental mechanism in `TCP` that prevents excessive data 
transmission from overwhelming the network, ensuring stable and efficient communication. 
In server-side game development, congestion control helps maintain smooth gameplay by 
dynamically adjusting the data flow based on network conditions. `TCP` employs various 
congestion control algorithms, such as `Reno`, `CUBIC`, and `BBR`, to detect congestion and 
reduce packet loss. These algorithms regulate the senders transmission rate using strategies 
like slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery. Proper tuning of congestion control 
mechanisms is critical for minimizing lag, preventing packet drops, and optimizing multiplayer
game performance, especially in high-traffic scenarios.
