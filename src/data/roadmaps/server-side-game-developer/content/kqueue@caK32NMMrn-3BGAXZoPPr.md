# kqueue  

**kqueue** is an efficient event notification system available on BSD-based operating systems, 
including macOS and FreeBSD. It is designed to handle large numbers of concurrent connections 
with minimal CPU overhead, making it well-suited for server-side game development. Similar 
to `epoll` on Linux, `kqueue` operates in an event-driven manner, allowing game servers to 
efficiently manage network events, timers, and file system changes. By reducing unnecessary 
polling and system calls, `kqueue` helps improve the scalability and responsiveness of 
multiplayer game servers, ensuring low-latency interactions and optimized resource usage.
