# epoll  

**epoll** is a high-performance I/O event notification system in Linux, essential for handling 
large-scale asynchronous network operations in server-side game development. Unlike `select` 
or `poll`, it uses an event-driven model, reducing CPU overhead and improving scalability. 
Game servers leverage `epoll` to efficiently manage thousands of concurrent connections, 
responding only when events occur, minimizing system calls, and optimizing resource 
usageâ€”making it ideal for multiplayer games and real-time applications.
