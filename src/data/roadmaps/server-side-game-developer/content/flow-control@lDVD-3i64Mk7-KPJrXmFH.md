# Flow Control

**Flow control** is a crucial mechanism in `TCP` that regulates data transmission between a sender 
and a receiver to prevent network congestion and packet loss. In server-side game development,
effective flow control ensures smooth data transfer, reducing latency and improving real-time 
responsiveness for multiplayer games. `TCP` uses techniques like sliding window protocols, where 
the receiver dictates how much data it can handle at a time, preventing buffer overflows. 
Additionally, congestion control algorithms like `TCP Reno` and `CUBIC` help dynamically adjust 
transmission rates based on network conditions. Proper flow control tuning is essential for 
maintaining stable connections, minimizing lag, and optimizing server performance in 
high-traffic gaming environments.
