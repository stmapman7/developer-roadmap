# TDD

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the implementation of the code they are testing. The idea behind TDD is to write a failing test first, then write just enough code to make the test pass, and then refactor the code if necessary. This process is repeated for each new feature or requirement that is added to the app.
