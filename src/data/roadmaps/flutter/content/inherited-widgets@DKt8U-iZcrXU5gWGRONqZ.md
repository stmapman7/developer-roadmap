# Inherited Widgets

Inherited widgets in Flutter are a powerful mechanism for efficiently propagating data down the widget tree. They essentially create a shared data scope that descendant widgets can access without needing to explicitly pass the data through constructors. When a widget needs to access data from an ancestor, it can simply look up the nearest inherited widget of the desired type.
