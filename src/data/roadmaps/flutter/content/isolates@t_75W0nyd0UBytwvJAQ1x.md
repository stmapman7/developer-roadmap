# Isolates

Flutter Isolates are parallel execution contexts that enhance performance and concurrency by running intensive tasks in the background, preventing UI freezes. They provide isolated memory spaces for reliable code, enable concurrent execution, and facilitate inter-isolate communication for data sharing and coordination, though developers must consider context-switching and communication overhead.
