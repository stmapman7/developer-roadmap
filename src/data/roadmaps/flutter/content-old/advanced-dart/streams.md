# Streams

Streams in Flutter are a way to receive data over time as it becomes available. They are similar to observables in other languages and frameworks. Streams can be used for things like getting real-time updates from a server, or listening for changes in user input. In Flutter, streams are represented by the `Stream` class and can be listened to using the `StreamBuilder` widget.
