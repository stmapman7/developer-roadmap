# Lambdas

Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions, are a fundamental concept in Dart and Flutter. They are a way to create short, inline functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

Lambdas are defined using the `=>` operator and can take zero or more arguments. They can also contain expressions, statements, and return values.
