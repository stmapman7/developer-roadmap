# Async Await

Flutter's `async`/`await` pattern simplifies asynchronous programming by enabling code that appears synchronous. The `async` keyword designates a function as asynchronous, allowing non-blocking execution, while `await` pauses execution until an asynchronous operation completes, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable asynchronous code.
