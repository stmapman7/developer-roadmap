# Unit Testing

Unit testing in Flutter is the process of testing individual units of code, such as functions or classes, to ensure that they behave as expected. Unit testing helps to catch bugs early in the development process and increases the confidence in your code by making it easier to refactor or make changes without breaking existing functionality.
