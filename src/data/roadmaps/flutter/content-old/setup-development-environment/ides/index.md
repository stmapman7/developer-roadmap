An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, testing, and deploying software.

These IDEs provide a variety of features and tools to assist in the development of Flutter apps, including code completion, debugging, testing, and more. Developers can choose the IDE that works best for their needs and preferences.
