# Tee

The `tee` command reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and files simultaneously, like a T-splitter in plumbing. It enables users to view results in the terminal while saving output to files concurrently. Syntax: `command | tee file`. Extremely useful for documenting terminal activities and preserving command outputs for later analysis.
