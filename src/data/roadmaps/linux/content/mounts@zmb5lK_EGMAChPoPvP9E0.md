# Mounts

Mounting in Linux attaches filesystems to specific directories (mount points) in the directory tree, allowing the OS to access data on storage devices. The `mount` command performs this operation. Example: `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt` mounts second partition to `/mnt` directory. The `/mnt` directory is conventionally used for temporary mounting operations. Essential for Linux disk and filesystem management.
