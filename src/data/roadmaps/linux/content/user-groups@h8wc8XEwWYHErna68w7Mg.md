# Users and Groups

Linux user groups simplify system administration by managing collections of users with shared access rights to files and directories. Each user belongs to one or more groups, enabling privilege management without full superuser access. Management commands: `groupadd`, `groupdel`, `groupmod`, `usermod`, `gpasswd`. Essential for secure and organized system environments.
