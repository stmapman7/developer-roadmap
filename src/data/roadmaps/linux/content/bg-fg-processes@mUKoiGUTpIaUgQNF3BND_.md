# Background and Foreground Processes

Linux processes run in foreground (taking direct user input) or background (running independently). Send processes to background with `&` or `bg` command. Bring to foreground with `fg`. Use Ctrl+Z to pause, then `bg` to resume in background. Part of job control for managing multiple tasks simultaneously from single terminal.
