# WC - Text Processing

The `wc` command is a commonly used tool in Unix or Linux that allows users to count the number of bytes, characters, words, and lines in a file or in data piped from standard input. The name `wc` stands for 'word count', but it can do much more than just count words. Common usage of `wc` includes tracking program output, counting code lines, and more. It's an invaluable tool for analyzing text at both granular and larger scales.
