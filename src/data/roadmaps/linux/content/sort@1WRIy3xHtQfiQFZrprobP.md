# Sort

Linux provides a variety of tools for processing and manipulating text files, one of which is the sort command. The `sort` command in Linux is used to sort the contents of a text file, line by line. The command uses ASCII values to sort files. You can use this command to sort the data in a file in a number of different ways such as alphabetically, numerically, reverse order, or even monthly. The sort command takes a file as input and prints the sorted content on the standard output (screen).
