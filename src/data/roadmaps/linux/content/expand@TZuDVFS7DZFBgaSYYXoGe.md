# Expand

The `expand` command converts tabs to spaces in text files, useful for consistent formatting across different systems and editors. Default conversion is 8 spaces per tab. Use `expand filename` for basic conversion or `expand -t 4 filename` to specify 4 spaces per tab. Essential for maintaining code readability and consistent indentation in shell scripts.
