# User Management

Linux user management allows multiple users to interact with the system in isolation. Includes creating, deleting, modifying users and groups, assigning permissions and ownership. Key commands: `adduser`/`useradd` creates users, `deluser`/`userdel` removes users, `passwd` manages passwords, `su` switches users. Essential for providing proper accessibility and maintaining Linux system security.
