# Snap

Snap is a modern Linux package management system by Canonical providing self-contained packages with all dependencies included. Snaps run consistently across different Linux distributions, install from Snapcraft store, and update automatically. Updates are transactional with automatic rollback on failure. Install packages using `sudo snap install [package-name]` command.
