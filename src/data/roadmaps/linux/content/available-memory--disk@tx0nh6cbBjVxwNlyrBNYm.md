# Available Memory and Disk

Linux provides tools like `free`, `vmstat`, and `top` to monitor system memory usage and performance. The `free -h` command shows total, used, free, shared, buffer/cache, and available memory in human-readable format. Regular memory monitoring helps maintain optimal server performance, prevent overload, and troubleshoot resource issues effectively.
