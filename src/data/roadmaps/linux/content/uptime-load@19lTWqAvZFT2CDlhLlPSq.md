# Uptime and Load

The `uptime` command shows system running time and load averages for 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals. Load average indicates computational work and processes waiting for CPU time. High load suggests insufficient resources or misconfigurations. Example: `uptime` shows "2 days, 20 min" uptime and "0.00, 0.01, 0.05" load averages. Essential for performance monitoring and capacity planning.
