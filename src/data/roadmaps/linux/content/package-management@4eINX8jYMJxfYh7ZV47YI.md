# Package Management

Package management handles software installation, updates, configuration, and removal in Linux. It manages collections of files and tracks software prerequisites automatically. Common package managers include `apt` (Debian-based), `yum`/`dnf` (Red Hat-based), and `pacman` (Arch). Example: `sudo apt install <package-name>` installs packages. Essential for efficient application management.
