# Tail Command

The `tail` command in Linux is a utility used in text processing. Fundamentally, it's used to output the last part of the files. The command reads data from standard input or from a file and outputs the last `N` bytes, lines, blocks, characters or words to the standard output (or a different file). By default, `tail` returns the last 10 lines of each file to the standard output. This command is common in situations where the user is interested in the most recent entries in a text file, such as log files.
