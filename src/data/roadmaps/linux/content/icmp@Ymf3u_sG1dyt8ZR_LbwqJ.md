# ICMP

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supportive protocol used by network devices to communicate error messages and operational information. Essential for Linux network troubleshooting, ICMP enables tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to diagnose network connectivity and routing issues. Use `ping www.google.com` to send ICMP echo requests and test network reachability effectively.
