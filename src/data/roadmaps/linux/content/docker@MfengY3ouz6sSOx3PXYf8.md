# Docker

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package applications with dependencies into lightweight containers. In Linux, Docker containers share the kernel and use features like namespaces and cgroups for isolation. This provides less overhead than traditional VMs while enabling consistent deployment across environments.
