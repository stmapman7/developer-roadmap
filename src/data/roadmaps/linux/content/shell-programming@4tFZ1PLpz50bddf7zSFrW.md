Shell programming (scripting) automates administrative tasks, repetitive operations, and system monitoring in Linux. Bash is the default shell and scripting language in most distributions. Scripts are text files executed by the shell, excellent for system automation. Example: `#!/bin/bash echo "Hello, World!"` creates a simple script that prints output to terminal.
