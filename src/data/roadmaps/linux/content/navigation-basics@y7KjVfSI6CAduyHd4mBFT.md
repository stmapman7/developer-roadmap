In Linux, navigation between directories and files is a fundamental, yet essential function that allows you to exploit the power of the command-line interface (CLI). Mastering the basic Linux navigation commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` enables you to flawlessly move from one point to another within the filesystem, display the list of files & directories, and understand your position relative to other system components.
