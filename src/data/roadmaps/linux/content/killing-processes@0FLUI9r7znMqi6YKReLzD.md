# Killing Processes

The `kill` command terminates processes in Linux by sending signals to specific Process IDs (PIDs). Use `kill [signal] PID` to terminate processes manually. Different signals provide various termination methods - SIGTERM for graceful shutdown, SIGKILL for forced termination. Process termination is essential for managing unresponsive or unwanted processes.
