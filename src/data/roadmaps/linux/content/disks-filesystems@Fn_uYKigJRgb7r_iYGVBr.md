# Disks and Filesystems

Linux uses various filesystems to organize, store, and retrieve data from storage devices. Popular filesystems include EXT4 (robust for Linux volumes), FAT32 (compatible with all OS for removable media), NTFS, and Btrfs. Each has specific advantages and use cases. Use `df -T` command to display filesystem types, disk space usage, and mounted device information.
