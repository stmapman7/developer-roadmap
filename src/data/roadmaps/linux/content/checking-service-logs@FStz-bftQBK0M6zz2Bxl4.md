# Checking Service Logs

System logs are essential for troubleshooting and monitoring Linux systems. Most logs are stored in `/var/log` directory and managed by systemd. Use `journalctl` to view system logs and `journalctl -u service_name` for specific service logs. The `dmesg` command displays kernel messages. Regular log monitoring is crucial for system administration.
