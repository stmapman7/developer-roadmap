# Tr-Command

The `tr` command in Linux is a command-line utility that translates or substitutes characters. It reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output. Although commonly used for translation applications, `tr` has versatile functionality in the text processing aspect of Linux. Ranging from replacing a list of characters, to deleting or squeezing character repetitions, `tr` presents a robust tool for stream-based text manipulations.
