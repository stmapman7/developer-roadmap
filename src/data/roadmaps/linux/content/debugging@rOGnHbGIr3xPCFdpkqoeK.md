# Debugging

Shell script debugging in Linux uses tools like bash's `-x` option for execution traces, `trap`, `set` commands, and external tools like `shellcheck`. Use `#!/bin/bash -x` in scripts or `bash -x script.sh` from command line for tracing. These debugging options help detect, trace, and fix errors to make scripts more efficient and error-proof.
