# Install, Remove, and Upgrade Packages

Linux package management handles installing, removing, and upgrading pre-compiled software modules. Different distributions use specific package managers: `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu), `yum`/`dnf` (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS), `zypper` (SUSE). Example installation: `sudo apt-get install packagename`. Each manager has specific commands for removal and upgrades. Critical skill for effective Linux system administration.
