# Service Status

Service status shows the current state of Linux services including network processes, backend servers, and background applications. Use `systemctl status service_name` to check service states through systemd manager. Example: `systemctl status apache2.service` shows Apache web server status. Essential for diagnosing problems, maintaining performance, and preventing service downtimes.
