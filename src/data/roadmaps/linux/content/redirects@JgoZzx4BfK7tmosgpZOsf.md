# Redirects

The shell in Linux provides a robust way of managing input and output streams of a command or program, this mechanism is known as Redirection. Linux being a multi-user and multi-tasking operating system, every process typically has 3 streams opened:

*   Standard Input (stdin) - This is where the process reads its input from. The default is the keyboard.
*   Standard Output (stdout) - The process writes its output to stdout. By default, this means the terminal.
*   Standard Error (stderr) - The process writes error messages to stderr. This also goes to the terminal by default.
