# Understanding Directory Hierarchy

In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux system's directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.

- `/`: Root directory, the top level of the file system.
- `/home`: User home directories.
- `/bin`: Essential binary executables.
- `/sbin`: System administration binaries.
- `/etc`: Configuration files.
- `/var`: Variable data (logs, spool files).
- `/usr`: User programs and data.
- `/lib`: Shared libraries.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
- `/opt`: Third-party applications.
