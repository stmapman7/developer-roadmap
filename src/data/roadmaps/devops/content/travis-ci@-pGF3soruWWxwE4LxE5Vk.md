# Travis CI

Travis CI is a cloud-based continuous integration (CI) service that automatically builds and tests code changes in GitHub repositories. It helps streamline the software development process by automatically running tests and building applications whenever code is pushed or a pull request is made. Travis CI supports a variety of programming languages and provides integration with other tools and services, offering features like build matrix configurations, deployment pipelines, and notifications. Its ease of setup and integration with GitHub makes it a popular choice for open-source and private projects looking to implement CI/CD practices.
