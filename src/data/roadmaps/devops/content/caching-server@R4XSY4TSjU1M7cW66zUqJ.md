# Caching server

A caching server, also known as a proxy server or cache server, is a dedicated network server that saves web pages and other Internet content locally to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. It works by intercepting requests from clients, saving the responses from web servers, and serving cached content to subsequent requests for the same information. Caching servers can significantly improve response times and reduce network traffic, especially for frequently accessed content. They are commonly used in content delivery networks (CDNs), enterprise networks, and Internet service providers to optimize performance, reduce costs, and enhance user experience by serving content from a location closer to the end-user.
