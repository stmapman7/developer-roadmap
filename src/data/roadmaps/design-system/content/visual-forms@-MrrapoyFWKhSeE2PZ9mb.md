Visual forms focus on aesthetic and interactive design aspects of form components. Effective design should establish clear information architecture, create consistent field styling, develop harmonious label positioning, design clear error communication, implement progressive enhancement, prioritize mobile-first design, and ensure cross-platform consistency.
