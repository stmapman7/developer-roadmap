Banners communicate important information at the top of pages. They should support different message types with distinct visuals, various positioning options, clear dismissal mechanisms, relevant actions, consistent iconography, mobile adaptations, subtle animations, content guidelines, proper accessibility, and stacking rules for multiple banners.
