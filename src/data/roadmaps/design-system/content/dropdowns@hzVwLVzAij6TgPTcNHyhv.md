Dropdowns reveal option lists when activated to save space. They need clear triggers with visual indicators, organized options with grouping, search/filtering for long lists, multi-select support, smart positioning, full keyboard navigation, loading states, mobile adaptations, proper accessibility, and performance optimization.
