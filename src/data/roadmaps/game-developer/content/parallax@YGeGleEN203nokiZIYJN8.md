# Parallax

In game development and graphics, parallax refers to the apparent displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. In simpler terms, parallax is a technique used to create the illusion of depth in 2D environments by moving background layers at different speeds relative to the foreground.
