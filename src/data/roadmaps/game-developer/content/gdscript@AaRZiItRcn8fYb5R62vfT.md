# GDScript

GDScript is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language designed specifically for the Godot Engine, an open-source game development platform. It is tailored for ease of use and rapid development of game logic and functionality. GDScript features a syntax similar to Python, which simplifies learning and coding for developers familiar with Python, while providing direct access to Godot's rich set of built-in functions and game-specific APIs. The language integrates closely with Godot's scene system and scripting environment, enabling developers to create and manipulate game objects, handle input, and control game behavior efficiently.
