# C / C++

**C** and **C++ (commonly known as CPP)** are two of the most foundational high-level programming languages in computer science. **C** was developed in the 1970s and it is a procedural language, meaning it follows a step-by-step approach. Its fundamental principles include structured programming and lexical variable scope.

On the other hand, **C++** follows the paradigm of both procedural and object-oriented programming. It was developed as an extension to C to add the concept of "classes" - a core feature of object-oriented programming. C++ enhances C by introducing new features like function overloading, exception handling, and templates.
