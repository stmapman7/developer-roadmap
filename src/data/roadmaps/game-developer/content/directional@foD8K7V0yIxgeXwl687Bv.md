# Directional

Directional light simulates a distant light source like the sun. It has only a direction, not a specific position, meaning its light rays are parallel and cast consistent shadows regardless of object location within the scene. This makes it ideal for simulating sunlight or moonlight, providing realistic outdoor lighting while being relatively performant for rendering.
