# Collision Detection

**Collision Detection** is a critical aspect in game physics that handles the computerâ€™s ability to calculate and respond when two or more objects come into contact in a game environment. This is vital to ensure objects interact realistically, don't pass through each other, and impact the game world in intended ways. Techniques for collision detection can vary based on the complexity required by the game. Simple methods may involve bounding boxes or spheres that encapsulate objects. When these spheres or boxes overlap, a collision is assumed. More complex methods consider the object's shape and volume for precise detection. Several libraries and game engines offer built-in support for collision detection, making it easier for developers to implement in their games.
