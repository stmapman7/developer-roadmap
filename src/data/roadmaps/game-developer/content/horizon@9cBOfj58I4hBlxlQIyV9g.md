# Horizon

In graphics, the horizon refers to a horizontal line that represents the visual boundary where the sky meets the earth or a flat surface, such as the ocean. It's a fundamental concept in perspective and art, serving as a reference point for creating a sense of depth and distance in an image. The placement of the horizon line can significantly impact the composition and mood of an image, with high or low horizon lines creating different effects on the viewer's perception of the scene.
