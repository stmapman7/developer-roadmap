Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. In terms of game development, machine learning can be used to create NPCs that can learn from the player's actions and adapt to them.
