# GJK

The **GJK algorithm** (Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi) is a computational geometry algorithm that is widely used to detect collisions between convex objects in video games and simulations. The primary role of this algorithm is to assess the intersection between two convex shapes. What makes it unique and widely used is its efficiency and accuracy even when dealing with complex three-dimensional shapes. It uses the concept of "Minkowski Difference" to simplify its calculations and determine if two shapes are intersecting.
