# Markov System

A **Markov System** or **Markov Chain** represents a statistical model that is used in decision-making scenarios within game development. This model is based on the notion of "memorylessness" where a certain event's probability depends solely on the state attained in the previous event. It employs a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event hinges on the state achieved in the previous event. A common usage of a Markov System is in designing AI behavior within games, where each state symbolizes a different behavior, and transitions between them are governed by the Markov chain probabilities.
