# Decision Tree

A **Decision Tree** is a graphical representation used in game development which helps to visualize the possible outcomes or paths a game could take depending on certain choices made by a gamer. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision, outcome, or reaction and each node on the tree represents a game situation or event. Decision Trees help game developers in making strategic designs, create complex enemy AI, and overall assists in predicting the interaction or course of the game. It allows game developers to layout the decision points, possible choices and their outcomes, thus making it easier to trace the direction in which the game progresses.
