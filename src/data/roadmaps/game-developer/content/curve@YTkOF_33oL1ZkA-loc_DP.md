# Curve

A `curve` in game development is a mathematical tool for creating smooth lines or paths, used in areas like animation, 3D modeling, UI design, and level layouts. Curves simplify complex shapes and movements, enabling more natural results compared to linear approaches. They're key for `lifelike animations`, organic shapes, `realistic physics`, and smooth camera movements, essential for polished, fluid game design.
