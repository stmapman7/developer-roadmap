# Light

Light refers to a visual representation of illumination in a 3D environment. It is used to simulate the way light behaves in the real world, adding depth, volume, and realism to objects and scenes. Lighting can be categorized into different types, such as ambient, diffuse, specular, and emissive, each serving a specific purpose in creating a believable and immersive visual experience. Proper lighting can greatly enhance the mood, atmosphere, and overall aesthetic of a scene, making it an essential aspect of graphics and game development.
