# Fog

Fog in game development refers to a visual effect used to simulate atmospheric conditions and enhance the depth perception in a game environment. It creates a gradient of visibility, often fading objects into the background, which can improve performance by reducing the number of objects rendered at a distance. Fog can be implemented in various ways, such as linear fog, which gradually obscures objects based on their distance from the camera, or exponential fog, which creates a more dramatic effect by rapidly increasing the density of fog with distance.
