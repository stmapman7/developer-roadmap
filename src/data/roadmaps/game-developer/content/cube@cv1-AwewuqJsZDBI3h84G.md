# Cube

In computer graphics, "cube" in the context of shadows often refers to using a cube-shaped object to visualize the concept of a "shadow volume." Imagine a light source shining on a cube. The silhouette of the cube from the light's perspective, extended infinitely outwards, forms a volume. Any object inside this "shadow volume" is considered to be in shadow. While helpful for understanding, shadow volumes themselves are not always shaped like cubes - their complexity depends on the object casting the shadow.
