Game AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that is used to create video game characters that act and react like real human players. Game AI is used in a variety of video games, from simple puzzle games to complex strategy games. Game AI can be used to create non-player characters (NPCs) that interact with the player, as well as to create intelligent opponents that challenge the player.
