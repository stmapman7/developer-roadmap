Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure and organize code. In OOP, an object is an instance of a class, which is a template that defines the properties and behaviors of the object. OOP is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
