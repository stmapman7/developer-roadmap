# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems, often using higher-order functions, immutability, and recursion. Instead of modifying data, functional programming creates new data structures.
