    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Golang better than Python?',
    answer: [
      'Golang is not intrinsically better than Python, just like any other language is not better than any available alternative. This is because when we\'re comparing programming languages, we need to add context to that comparison to understand how those languages are going to be used, what systems are they going to be running in, and many other questions that you need to ask before emitting judgment.',
      'That said, if we\'re trying to compare apples to apples, then we gotta think that comparing Golang and Python involves evaluating the specific strengths and applications of each language.',
      'Golang is designed for efficiency, concurrency, and robust system-level programming, making it ideal for building scalable backend services and high-efficiency tools. Its straightforward syntax and built-in features enable developers to create optimized applications. Python, on the other hand, excels in rapid prototyping, data science, and machine learning, thanks to its extensive libraries and ease of use for complex analytical tasks.',
      'The decision on whether Golang is better than Python depends on the project requirements (that "context" we mentioned before): Go may be preferable for building concurrent, performant services, while Python is often chosen for its flexibility in scientific computing and AI development. More here: [Go vs Python compared](https://roadmap.sh/golang/vs-python).',

    question: 'Is Golang as fast as C++?',
    answer: [
      'Golang is not as fast as C++. While Golang is, indeed, engineered for efficiency and performance, offering an amazing speed for many applications, it can\'t match the raw speed achieved by a lower-level language such as C++.',
      'Generally speaking, C++ excels in raw speed and low-level control over system resources, making it the preferred choice for scenarios requiring maximum efficiency. However, this comes at the cost of complexity, as lower-level languages offer fewer abstraction layers compared to higher-level ones like Go. In the end, it\'s all about trade-offs.',
      'Despite this, Golang strikes an excellent balance between efficiency and ease of development, which is a notable achievement for a high-level language.',
      'Its built-in garbage collection, clear syntax, and comprehensive standard library make it a practical alternative for developers who seek a more accessible yet high-performing programming language.',

    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Go better than Rust?',
    answer: [
      'Go is not better than Rust, nor is Rust intrinsically better than Go. If you think about it, neither Go nor Rust is universally better. Each has its own set of strengths, coming into their own under different circumstances.',
      'For instance, Go, with its crisp, simple syntax and a suite of built-in tools, is great for fast problem solving. Its design, simple and avoiding complexity at all costs, allows teams to adopt it for service deployment and efficient code resolution.',
      'On the other side you have Rust, which merits its own place in the podium for its focus on memory safety and detailed control over system resources. Its lower abstraction level (Rust is closer to the machine) explains its steeper learning curve, however, that also makes it a more challenging technology to pick up.',
      'In the end, the choice between Go and Rust reflects the specific needs of a project and the unique expertise of a team. For those seeking rapid, straightforward development, Go might be the path forward; and for applications where granular control and increased efficiency are paramount, Rust could very well be the preferred tool.',
