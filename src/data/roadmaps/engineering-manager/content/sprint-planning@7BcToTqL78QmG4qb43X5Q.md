An Engineering Manager plays a pivotal role in sprint planning. They lead the team in defining the project's scope for the next sprint, taking into account the team's capacity and the project's priorities. They ensure team members understand tasks and their importance.

Their responsibilities include setting realistic objectives, aligning with stakeholders, and securing required resources. They reconcile the business needs and technical feasibility, ensuring high-value features are developed first.

The challenges in sprint planning often revolve around resource allocation, maintaining quality, and managing risks. Good communication, leadership, and negotiation skills are required to effectively drive sprint planning. The Engineering Manager must be adept at balancing speed, quality, and the team's capabilities while ensuring alignment with the project's overall goals.
