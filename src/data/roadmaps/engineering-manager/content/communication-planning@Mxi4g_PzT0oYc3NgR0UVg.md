# Communication planning

An Engineering Manager is pivotal in communication planning during organizational changes. His key tasks are to ensure timely and clear communication to prevent confusion and keep the team committed. They keep a balance between providing too much detail that would overwhelm and too little that might result in anxiety and fear.

The manager can face issues like hesitance from teams to change or rumors spreading due to unclear messages. To mitigate these, he needs to create an effective communication plan, ensuring that it is proactive and on-going, so the team remains informed about the changes.

Lastly, having strong leadership and communication skills will enable the Engineering Manager to successfully guide their team through the change. Also, empathy and patience are needed, as change can be stressful and it takes time for people to adjust.
