# Project Postmortems

Project postmortems are a crucial part of an Engineering Manager's role in project management. They allow the manager to evaluate a project after it's completed to understand what went well and what needs improvement. As a leader, the Engineering Manager typically steers this process, encouraging team members to discuss their experiences and draw valuable lessons.

A primary challenge is ensuring that postmortems are constructive, not blame-seeking. They need to encourage transparency amongst the team. This calls for a balanced and diplomatic approach from the manager. By promoting an open environment and focusing on lessons learned rather than individual mistakes, Engineering Managers can turn postmortems into a positive and enriching experience.

Doing successful postmortems requires good communication and analytical skills. The manager must distil complex issues into easy-to-understand takeaways that can guide future projects. The ultimate goal is continuous improvement, and a good postmortem is a stepping stone towards that.
