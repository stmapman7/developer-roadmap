# Technology adoption

An Engineering Manager has a vital role during technology adoption as a part of technical change management. They evaluate technologies to determine their suitability for the team's needs. This includes assessing the impact of new technologies on existing systems, workflows, and team skills.

Engineering Managers are responsible for planning the adoption process, communicating changes to the team, and overseeing implementation. This minimizes disruption and ensures a smooth transition to the new technology. They must also organize training sessions to help team members get up to speed with the new technology.

One of the challenges faced by Engineering Managers during technology adoption is resistance to change. They must manage this tactfully by highlighting the benefits of the new technology, and ensuring everyone's concerns are addressed. Strong communication skills and a patient approach are required for this.
