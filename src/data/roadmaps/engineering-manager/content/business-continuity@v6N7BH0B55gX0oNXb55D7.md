# Business continuity

An Engineering Manager plays a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining business continuity. Their key responsibilities include forming strategies to ensure continuous service delivery and minimize downtime during unforeseen circumstances. They are heavily involved in the creation and maintenance of disaster recovery plans, as well as testing their effectiveness.

Challenges faced could be situations like system failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks etc. Addressing these requires effective risk analysis, strategic decision-making and coordination with other teams. Successful risk mitigation calls for vigilant monitoring of systems and prompt action during contingencies.

Thus, apart from strong technical understanding, effective communication, foresight, and quick decision-making abilities are essential skills for an Engineering Manager to ensure business continuity. The ultimate goal is to safeguard the company's technologies and services from substantial operational interruptions.
