# Timeline Estimation

Timeline estimation is a vital part of an Engineering Manager's role. Typically, they'll leverage their experience, industry knowledge, and sometimes, gut feeling, to envisage a project's duration. They are responsible for considering factors such as workload, complexity, team size, and risks to determine a realistic timeline.

They often face challenges in ensuring that timelines are accurate and achievable. This can be from uncertain project requirements or unforeseen obstacles. To combat these, a good approach is to use methods like PERT or 'Three-point estimation' which factor in the best, worst and most likely scenarios.

To thrive in timeline estimation, Engineering Managers need a fine balance of technical depth, data analysis skills, probability knowledge, and communication proficiency. Robust project management tools to visually map progress can also be invaluable.
