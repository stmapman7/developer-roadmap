# Contingency planning

An Engineering Manager needs to ensure that their team is prepared for any unexpected situations or challenges - that's where contingency planning comes into play. It's the manager's responsibility to guide their team in developing robust plans that address potential risks and uncertainties. This includes identifying possible obstacles, evaluating their impact, and devising strategies to mitigate them.

The challenges this role faces are manifold, from predicting the unknown to dealing with a resistant team. To navigate these, cultivating an open and flexible team culture is crucial. By fostering a problem-solving mentality, the manager can encourage their team to see contingency planning as a tool, not a burden.

To successfully play this role, an Engineering Manager needs to have strong risk management and strategic thinking skills. They must be able to balance a long-term view with immediate, tactical decisions. They should also be comfortable leading difficult conversations about potential failures and mishaps.
