# Production issues management

As an Engineering Manager, handling production issues is one of the vital responsibilities. This includes timeliness in identifying, troubleshooting, and resolving problems. They may be involved in the actual debugging, but most of their tasks involve coordinating the team and defining procedures for a swift response to any issues.

Addressing these issues can be challenging, particularly if they disrupt essential services or products. The manager needs to communicate effectively with the team and stakeholders, manage expectations, and ensure minimal interruption of services. 

To excel in production issues management, an Engineering Manager needs valuable skills. These include technical knowledge, critical thinking, decision-making, and strong communication skills. Also, experience with certain tools, like monitoring software, could be beneficial to quickly detect and resolve issues.
