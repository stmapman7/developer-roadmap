# Technology partnerships

Engineering Managers play a key role in fostering technology partnerships. It's a necessity for them to understand both the technical sides and value propositions of potential partners. They establish and maintain relationships based on mutual technology goals, and ensure that partners align with the overall strategy of their engineering team.

For partner management, Engineering Managers often need strong negotiation skills and a clear understanding of the business impact. They are responsible for regular partner check-ins and gauging the success of the partnership. A collaborative approach ensures that both parties receive benefits.

The challenge often lies in managing divergent priorities and expectations. To navigate this, an Engineering Manager needs effective communication and conflict resolution skills. They explore how technology partnerships can advance the teamâ€™s objectives, but also remain mindful of the risk and investment involved.
