# Knowledge bases

An Engineering Manager plays a crucial role in establishing solid knowledge bases for their team. This is a system where team members record, update, and share information about projects, coding practices, or other essential technical insights. The Engineering Manager is responsible for making sure that information is up-to-date, relevant, and easily accessible for everyone on the team.

A key challenge here can be information overload or outdated knowledge. The Manager needs to ensure the team regularly update the databases and that outdated information is removed promptly. This keeps the knowledge bases useful and efficient.

To succeed in this area, an Engineering Manager should promote open communication and regular updates among team members. Also, being competent in modern documentation tools can significantly assist in maintaining an effective knowledge base.
