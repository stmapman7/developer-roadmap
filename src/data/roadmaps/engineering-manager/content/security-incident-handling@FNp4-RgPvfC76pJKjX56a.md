# Security incident handling

An Engineering Manager plays a pivotal role in security incident handling. Key responsibilities include establishing protocols for incident response and ensuring the team is well-prepared to manage any security breach. The manager needs to promote a culture of security awareness, regularly updating the team on potential risks and implementing security best practices.

Challenges may include staying up-to-date with emerging threats and utilizing the appropriate technologies to defend against them. Crafting a strong incident response strategy can be complex, but a good manager will use their expertise to overcome these hurdles, adapting their approach as necessary.

Key skills include maintaining a level head under pressure, strong communication to coordinate team responses, and a deep understanding of potential security vulnerabilities. By applying these skills, an Engineering Manager can successfully negotiate the delicate balance between risk, security, and business needs.
