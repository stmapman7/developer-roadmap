# Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management is a critical part of an Engineering Manager's role. They must be able to clarify project goals, handle issues and create a shared vision among different stakeholders. Key responsibilities include steering meetings, managing expectations and providing regular progress updates.

One challenge is that each stakeholder may have different interests and priorities. Balancing these opposing views and reaching consensus can be tough. To handle this, Engineering Managers need to be tactical mediators with strong negotiation skills.

This role requires a mix of technical and soft skills. They need to understand underlying technologies and projects' unique dynamics. Alongside, strong communication skills to relay technical information in a non-technical way is essential. Good stakeholder management enhances trust and fosters a favorable working relationship among teams.
