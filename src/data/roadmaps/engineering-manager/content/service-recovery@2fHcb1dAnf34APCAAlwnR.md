# Service Recovery

Service recovery is a critical responsibility for an Engineering Manager. They lead their teams through restoring and maintaining essential services following any disruption. This could be due to a server failure, software crashes, or unexpected logical errors.

As this role requires swift and effective actions, Engineering Managers often face challenges in balancing resources, troubleshooting, and maintaining good communication with stakeholders. The ability to stay calm under pressure, effective problem-solving skills, and strong communication are key to succeeding in this area.

To handle these challenges, they define recovery plans, protocols, and procedures, coordinate with respective teams, manage necessary resources and, most importantly, learn from each incident. Improving over time helps prevent similar future incidents, ensuring the smooth running of the service.
