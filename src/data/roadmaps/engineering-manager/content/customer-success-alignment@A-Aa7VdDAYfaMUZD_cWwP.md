# Customer success alignment

An Engineering Manager’s involvement in customer success alignment is crucial. They ensure that the engineering team aligns with the customer’s needs and expectations. Key responsibilities include collaborating with the customer success team, understanding customer requirements, and making sure the engineering team is on the same page.

Challenges arise when there's a disconnect between what customers want and what the engineering team is set to deliver. But addressing them requires clear communication and strong problem-solving skills. Frequent interactions with the customer success team can foster the understanding necessary to prevent these issues.

Overall, succeeding in this area requires excellent interpersonal skills. It's also crucial for Engineering Managers to have good technical understanding to relate customer needs to engineering tasks effectively. This ensures that the end product deepens customer satisfaction and leads to continuous business growth.
