# Product strategy alignment

For an Engineering Manager, aligning product strategy requires strong tech understanding and the ability to connect it with business needs. They play an essential role in transforming the company's goals into a clearly defined product roadmap and help their team focus on what’s crucial for the product's success.

Their key responsibilities include engaging in cross-functional collaboration with product teams, understanding customer needs, and ensuring the tech team is building a product that aligns well with the company’s strategy. They also need to ensure ongoing alignment as products evolve and business goals change.

The major challenge faced in ensuring product strategy alignment includes maintaining a strong connection between engineering and non-engineering teams. To address this, they have to foster open communication, work closely with product managers, and ensure everyone understands the company’s strategic goals.
