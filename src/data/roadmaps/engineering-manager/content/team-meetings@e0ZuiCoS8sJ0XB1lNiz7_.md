# Team Meetings

An Engineering Manager's role in team meetings is, above all, to guide and inspire the team. They must set the agenda and ensure that all key points are discussed to move projects forward. Clear communication is crucial, as is the ability to listen to the team's feedback and ideas. An open and inclusive environment can help encourage freely sharing thoughts and solutions.

One of the challenges faced as an Engineering Manager concerns ensuring that everyone's voice is heard, and no time is wasted. They address this challenge with efficient time management and inclusive discussion habits. For instance, the use of meeting timers and round-robin discussion techniques can help.

To succeed in this aspect, managers need strong organizational and interpersonal skills. They should also have the ability to value different perspectives, fostering a culture of respect and open-mindedness.
