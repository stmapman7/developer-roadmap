# Cross-department collaboration

Cross-department collaboration is crucial for an Engineering Manager. They are responsible for coordinating with teams outside their department to align goals, synchronize work, and facilitate project completion. This requires well-honed communication skills, efficient leadership tactics, and effective collaboration strategies.

Challenges may arise due to departmental silos, different priorities or workflow disparities. To address these issues, the Engineering Manager should promote open dialogue, ensure mutual understanding of shared objectives, and create clear workflows.

To excel in cross-department collaboration, a holistic understanding of the entire business is needed. The ability to advocate for the needs of the Engineering Team while understanding the requirements of other departments creates a balanced approach that aids in achieving the organizational objectives.
