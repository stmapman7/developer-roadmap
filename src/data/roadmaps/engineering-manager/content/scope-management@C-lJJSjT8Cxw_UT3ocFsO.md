# Scope Management

As an Engineering Manager, scope management is crucial because it ensures all work required, and only the work required, is included in the project. Their key role involves defining the scope, focusing on the project requirements, and acknowledging potential scope creep scenarios which may deviate the project from its objectives.

The challenges faced often include managing the team's expectations and time, while striving to deliver a product that meets client's specs on time & budget. They need to delegate tasks effectively and ensure everyone sticks to the agreed scope.

To excel in scope management, one requires assertiveness, excellent communication and interpersonal skills and the knack for anticipating potential hurdles. A proficiency in risk management also plays a crucial role in preventing scope creep.
