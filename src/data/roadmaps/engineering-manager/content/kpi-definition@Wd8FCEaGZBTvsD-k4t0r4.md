# KPI Definition

An Engineering Manager is pivotal in the process of defining key performance indicators (KPIs) for a project. They identify the crucial metrics that reflect success and are aligned with the project goals. To accomplish this, they work closely with their team and other stakeholders, clarifying the key outcomes that matter most.

The definition of KPIs can be challenging due to the potential range of metrics available. The Engineering Manager must strike a balance between choosing relevant KPIs and avoiding those which may inflate success results artificially. They address this challenge by focusing on KPIs that accurately measure performance and drive improvement.

Strong analytical skills, critical thinking and a firm understanding of their team's capabilities and project goals are crucial for an Engineering Manager to succeed in this aspect. Continuous evaluation and flexibility in adapting the KPIs are also imperative.
