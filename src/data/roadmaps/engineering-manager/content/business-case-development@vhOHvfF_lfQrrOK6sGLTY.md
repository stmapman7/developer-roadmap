# Business Case Development

An Engineering Manager often takes on the responsibility of Business Case Development. This means they analyze and present possible outcomes of a project or decision. It's essential for them to understand the business side, not only the technical side.

While it can be challenging, a proper business case helps guide investments. The manager must address all crucial aspects: costs, benefits, risks, and timelines. They need to present compelling reasons to take on a project to stakeholders.

To succeed, they need excellent analytical and communication skills. Understanding how decisions impact their team and business is paramount. They should also be able to clearly explain their findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
