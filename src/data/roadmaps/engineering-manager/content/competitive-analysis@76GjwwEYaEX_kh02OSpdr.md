# Competitive Analysis

An Engineering Manager uses competitive analysis for strategic thinking in various ways. They use it to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their own team and products compared to their competitors. This helps them pinpoint areas for improvement and innovation. Also, it guides them in making decisions about resource allocation, project prioritization, and technology choices.

Their key responsibility in this area is to ensure the team stays abreast of industry trends. They must create a strong competitive stance in the areas they are lagging. They face challenges when there's limited information about the competition or rapid changes in the market landscape.

To succeed, Engineering Managers need good analytical and research skills. They should have the ability to use different tools and methods for gathering and analyzing data. They also need strong decision-making ability to interpret findings and create action plans based on them.
