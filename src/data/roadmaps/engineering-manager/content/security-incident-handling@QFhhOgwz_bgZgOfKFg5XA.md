# Security incident handling

For an Engineering Manager, handling security incidents within a team involves keen attention to detail and quick actions. Their key responsibilities include coordinating with the security team to manage the issue and ensure minimal disruption to the project. They also facilitate communications, keeping all stakeholders informed about the situation and the steps being taken.

Challenges faced by the Engineering Manager include managing team stress levels during security incidents and ensuring swift return to normal operations post-incident. By skillfully juggling these tasks, the manager can help secure the team's trust and keep the project on track.

To successfully handle security incidents, an Engineering Manager needs active decision-making skills, a solid understanding of security protocols, and strong team leadership capabilities. The ability to react calmly and decisively under pressure is also essential.
