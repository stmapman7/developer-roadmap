# Budget requests

As an Engineering Manager, handling budget requests is more than just numbers. Itâ€™s about demonstrating the value of engineering efforts in clear business terms to executives. Here, their role is to justify the request by showing how the budget aligns with the team's goals and the company's strategic objectives. They often face the challenge of explaining technical necessities in a business-friendly language.

Engineering Managers need to quantify the team's needs - such as manpower, equipment, or resources - without overstuffing the budget. They should be skilled in translating the cost of these aspects into potential business benefits like improved efficiency or quality.

Crucially, the Engineering Manager should complement the budget request with a risk-assessment to anticipate potential obstacles. This shows foresight and an understanding of the business landscape, something executive teams appreciate.
