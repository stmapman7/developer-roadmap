# Stakeholder management

An Engineering Manager plays a critical role in stakeholder management during organizational change. They act as the link between the technical team and all other stakeholders (e.g., customer, management, or other teams). Their main responsibilities include communicating effectively about the impact of the proposed changes on the product delivery, ensuring that the stakeholders are on the same page about it.

The challenge here is that stakeholders may have different perspectives and respond differently to the change. To handle this, the Engineering Manager needs to have good negotiation skills and the ability to manage conflicts. They must present information in a way that maintains stakeholder buy-in throughout the process.

In essence, successful stakeholder management requires clear communication, empathy, and understanding of different stakeholder's needs. This ensures a smoother transition with minimal disruptions to the engineering workflow.
