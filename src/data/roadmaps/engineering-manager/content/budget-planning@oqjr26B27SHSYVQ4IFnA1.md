# Budget Planning

The role of an engineering manager extends beyond engineering tasks to include budget planning. Their duties include creating and overseeing the financial plan for their team. They need to estimate costs and ensure spending stays within set limits.

This aspect often introduces challenges - it's tricky to balance the optimal resource allocation, project expenses and salary provisions. Yet, successful managers navigate this by being forward-thinking, data-driven and having consistent communication with team members and finance departments.

To lead in this area, an engineering manager should hone skills in risk management, forecasting, and analysis. They need to understand and predict the financial impact of decisions, providing strategic input that ensures the department runs smoothly and cost-efficiently.
