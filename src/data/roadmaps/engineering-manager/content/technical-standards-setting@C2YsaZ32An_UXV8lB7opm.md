# Technical Standards Setting

Engineering Managers play a crucial role in the setting of technical standards. Their key responsibilities include identifying appropriate industry standards, ensuring the team's technical resources align with these standards, and implementing them consistently across all engineering projects.

A common challenge faced by Engineering Managers is sustaining a balance between maintaining high standards and keeping up with the speed of technology innovations. They can address this by staying abreast with the latest technology trends and adjustments in industry standards.

To succeed in this aspect, an Engineering Manager needs keen attention to detail, ability to research and comprehend complex technical concepts, and strong leadership skills to guide the team in aligning with these standards. Demonstrating flexibility and open-mindedness to change is also a crucial approach in managing evolving technical standards.
