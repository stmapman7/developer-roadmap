# Resistance management

In managing resistance during organizational change, an Engineering Manager's role involves identifying employees' concerns and fears. They work to address these issues by demonstrating empathy, opening communications, and providing solid reasons for the change. Addressing resistance may require new skills or adjustments to work styles, making training and support vital parts of the process.

Engineering Managers often face employees' fear of change, decreased morale, or reduced productivity during transitional periods. To navigate these challenges, they develop clear plans, communicate constantly about the change and the benefits it will bring, and involve employees in the change process to generate buy-in.

Success in resistance management requires strong emotional intelligence, solid communication skills, and the ability to motivate teams. Industries and situations vary, but maintaining transparency and empathy often result in positive outcomes.
