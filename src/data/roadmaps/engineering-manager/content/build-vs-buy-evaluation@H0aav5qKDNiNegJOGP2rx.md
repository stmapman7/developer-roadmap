# Build vs Buy Evaluation

An Engineering Manager navigates the "Build vs Buy" decision with precision. Their main responsibility is to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of developing in-house versus purchasing premade solutions. They must weigh up factors including cost, time, quality, and alignment with their company's long-term goals.

Challenges arise from needing to balance immediate needs with future scalability. This requires a careful understanding of available resources and potential growth. They mitigate this by keeping up-to-date with market trends and technology advancements that could affect their strategy.

A crucial skill for this area is financial and technical acumen, combined with foresight. Engineering Managers must ask critical questions about the total cost of ownership for both options, whether the company has the capable expertise, and whether the solution is future-proof.
