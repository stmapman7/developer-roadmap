# In-memory Data Structure Store

An in-memory database is a purpose-built database that relies primarily on internal memory for data storage. It enables minimal response times by eliminating the need to access standard disk drives (SSDs). In-memory databases are ideal for applications that require microsecond response times or have large spikes in traffic, such as gaming leaderboards, session stores, and real-time data analytics. The terms main memory database (MMDB), in-memory database system (IMDS), and real-time database system (RTDB) also refer to in-memory databases.
