# Active-Active geo Distribution

An Active-Active architecture is a data resiliency architecture that distributes the database information over multiple data centers via independent and geographically distributed clusters and nodes. It is a network of separate processing nodes, each having access to a common replicated database such that all nodes can participate in a common application ensuring local low latency with each region being able to run in isolation.
