# Key-value Database

Key-value Database is a non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. In this model, each piece of data is associated with a unique identifier (key) that is used to retrieve the corresponding value. This simple structure allows for high performance and scalability, making key-value databases ideal for certain use cases.
