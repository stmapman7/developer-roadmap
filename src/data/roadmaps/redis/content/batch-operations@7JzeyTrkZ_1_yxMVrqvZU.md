# Batch Operations

Batch operations in Redis allow you to execute multiple commands efficiently in a single network round-trip. While Redis does not have true batching like some databases (where a set of operations are sent together and processed atomically), it provides ways to send multiple commands together to reduce the overhead of individual network requests. These include Pipelining, Transactions (MULTI/EXEC), and Lua Scripting.
