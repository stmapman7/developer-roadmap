# BITCOUNT

The BITCOUNT command in Redis is used to count the number of bits set to 1 (i.e., the number of binary 1s) in the value stored at a specific key. Since Redis allows string values to be stored as binary data, the BITCOUNT command becomes useful for operations involving bits, like efficiently tracking and counting bits in binary-encoded data.
