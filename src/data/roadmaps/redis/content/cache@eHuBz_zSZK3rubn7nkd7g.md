# Cache

Redis cache is an in-memory key-value store used to cache frequently accessed data to improve application performance. By storing data in memory rather than on disk, Redis significantly reduces data access latency, making it ideal for use cases such as session management, caching database query results, and storing temporary data. Its ability to handle high throughput and support data persistence options allows it to be used as both a short-term cache and a durable data store.
