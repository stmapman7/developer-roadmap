# State Management

Durable Objects excel at state management. Each Durable Object instance has its own persistent storage and can maintain state across multiple requests. You can store data within a Durable Object and access it consistently, regardless of which Cloudflare edge server handles the request. This eliminates the need for external databases or caching layers for managing application state.
