# Persistence

Durable Objects offer built-in persistence. Data stored within a Durable Object is automatically persisted to Cloudflare's storage infrastructure. You don't need to explicitly save or load data; the Durable Object handles persistence automatically. This simplifies development and ensures that your application's state is durable and reliable, even in the face of server failures.
