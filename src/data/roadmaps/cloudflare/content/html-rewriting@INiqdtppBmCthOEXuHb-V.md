# HTML Rewriting

HTML rewriting with Cloudflare Workers enables you to modify HTML content on the fly. You can use Workers to parse HTML, manipulate elements, and inject new content. Common use cases include:

- A/B testing: Dynamically changing content for different users.
- Personalization: Tailoring the HTML based on user characteristics.
- Content injection: Adding analytics scripts or ads.
- Security enhancements: Removing potentially harmful code.

HTML rewriting allows you to customize the user experience and optimize your website without modifying the origin server.
