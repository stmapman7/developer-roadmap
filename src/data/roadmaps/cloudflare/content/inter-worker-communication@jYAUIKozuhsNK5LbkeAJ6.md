# Inter Worker Communication

Inter-Worker communication enables different Cloudflare Workers to interact and share data. This can be achieved through:

- **Durable Objects:** Workers can share persistent data and coordinate state using Durable Objects.
- **KV Storage:** Workers can read and write data to a shared KV namespace.
- **Webhooks:** One Worker can trigger another by sending a webhook request.

These methods allow you to build complex applications where different Workers handle specific tasks and collaborate to achieve a common goal.
