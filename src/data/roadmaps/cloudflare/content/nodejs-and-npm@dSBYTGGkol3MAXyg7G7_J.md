# Node.js and NPM

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

npm (Node Package Manager) is the standard package manager for Node.js. It is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
