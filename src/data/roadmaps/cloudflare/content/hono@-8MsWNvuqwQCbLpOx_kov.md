# Hono

Hono is a small, simple and ultra-fast web framework built on web standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js. Hono is more known for supporting a lot more than the basics.

Hono is a simple web application framework similar to the well known javascript framework Express, without a frontend. But it runs on CDN Edges and allows you to construct larger applications when combined with middleware.
