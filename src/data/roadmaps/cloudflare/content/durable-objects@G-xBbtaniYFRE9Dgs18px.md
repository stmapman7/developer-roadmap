# Durable Objects

Cloudflare Durable Objects provide a strongly consistent, single-actor execution environment on Cloudflare's edge network. Unlike Workers, which are stateless, Durable Objects maintain state, enabling you to build applications that require coordination and data consistency across multiple requests and users. They are ideal for building collaborative applications, real-time games, and other stateful services.
