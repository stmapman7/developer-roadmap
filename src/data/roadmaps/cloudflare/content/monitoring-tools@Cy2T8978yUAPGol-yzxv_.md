# Monitoring Tools

Monitoring tools provide insights into the performance and health of your Cloudflare applications. Cloudflare offers built-in analytics, but you can also integrate with external monitoring services like Datadog, New Relic, or Prometheus. These tools allow you to track metrics such as:

- Request latency
- Error rates
- Cache hit ratio
- Resource usage

By monitoring these metrics, you can identify performance bottlenecks, detect security threats, and ensure your applications are running smoothly.
