# Browser Rendering

Cloudflare Browser Rendering allows you to render web pages in a headless browser environment on Cloudflare's edge network. This is useful for tasks like generating PDFs, taking screenshots, or pre-rendering content for SEO purposes. By performing browser rendering at the edge, you can offload processing from your origin server and improve performance for certain types of web applications.
