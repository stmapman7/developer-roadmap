# D1

Cloudflare D1 is a serverless SQL database designed to run on Cloudflare's edge network. It allows you to store and query data closer to your users, reducing latency and improving application performance. D1 is based on SQLite and is accessible directly from Cloudflare Workers, making it easy to build dynamic and data-driven applications without managing a traditional database server.
