# Asset Management

Cloudflare R2 can be used for efficient asset management. You can store images, videos, and other static assets in R2 and serve them directly through Cloudflare's CDN. This reduces the load on your origin server and improves website performance. R2's integration with Cloudflare Workers allows you to perform on-the-fly image transformations or other asset processing tasks at the edge. Versioning support in R2 helps manage different versions of your assets.
