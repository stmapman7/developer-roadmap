# R2 Storage

Cloudflare R2 Storage is a distributed object storage service that offers fast, reliable, and affordable storage without egress fees. It's designed to compete with services like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. R2 allows you to store large amounts of unstructured data (images, videos, documents) and access it quickly from anywhere in the world via Cloudflare's global network. Its key advantage is the absence of egress bandwidth charges, making it cost-effective for applications with high data retrieval needs.
