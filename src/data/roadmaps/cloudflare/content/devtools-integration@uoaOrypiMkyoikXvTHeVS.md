# DevTools Integration

Cloudflare Workers can be debugged using standard browser DevTools. When running Workers in a local environment (e.g., with Miniflare), you can use Chrome DevTools or similar tools to inspect code, set breakpoints, and step through execution. You can also use `console.log` statements to output information to the DevTools console. This integration makes debugging Workers more intuitive and efficient.
