# Similarity Search

Cloudflare offers Vectorize, a vector database, which enables similarity search. You can embed data (text, images, audio) as vectors and then use Vectorize to find the most similar vectors based on a query vector. This is used for recommendation systems, content discovery, and other applications where finding similar items is important.
