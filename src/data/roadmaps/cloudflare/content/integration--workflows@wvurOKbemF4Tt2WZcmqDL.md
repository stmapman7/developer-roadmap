# Integration & Workflows

Workflows refers to the automated processes you can create to manage and respond to various events or conditions. This often involves chaining together different Cloudflare features and potentially integrating with external services. Workflows enable you to automate tasks such as:

- Responding to security threats
- Optimizing website performance
- Managing user access
- Enforcing compliance policies

Cloudflare's strength lies in its ability to integrate various services and create automated workflows. You can connect Cloudflare with external platforms using webhooks or APIs. Workflows can automate tasks like responding to security events, optimizing performance based on real-time data, or managing user access. By integrating different components, you can build complex and efficient systems that leverage Cloudflare's global network.
