# Debugging Techniques

Debugging Cloudflare Workers involves several techniques:

- **Console Logging:** Using `console.log()` to output variables and track code execution.
- **`wrangler tail`:** Viewing real-time logs from your Worker in the command line.
- **Source Maps:** Mapping compiled code back to the original source for easier debugging.
- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Handling errors gracefully and logging relevant information.
- **Local Testing:** Using `wrangler dev` to test Workers locally before deployment.

These techniques help identify and resolve issues in your Workers effectively.
