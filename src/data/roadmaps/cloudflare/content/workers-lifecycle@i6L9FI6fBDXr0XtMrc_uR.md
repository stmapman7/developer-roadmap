# Workers Lifecycle

A Cloudflare Worker's lifecycle is short and stateless. Each invocation starts when a request hits the Cloudflare edge. The Worker executes its code to handle the request. Once the response is sent (or an error occurs), the Worker instance terminates. There's no persistent state between requests unless you use services like KV or Durable Objects. This stateless nature ensures scalability and quick response times. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for designing efficient Workers that can handle a high volume of requests.
