# Event-driven Architectures

Cloudflare Workers are well-suited for event-driven architectures. You can trigger Workers based on various events, such as:

- Incoming HTTP requests
- Scheduled tasks (using Cron Triggers)
- Webhooks from external services

This allows you to build reactive systems that respond to events in real-time. Workers can process events and trigger other actions, creating a chain reaction that automates complex tasks.
