# Cache API

Cloudflare's Cache API allows Workers to programmatically control caching behavior. You can store responses in Cloudflare's global cache and retrieve them later, reducing origin server load and improving performance. The Cache API offers fine-grained control over cache keys, expiration, and other parameters. This enables you to cache dynamic content, personalize responses, and optimize content delivery for specific users or devices. The Cache API is a powerful tool for building highly performant and scalable applications on Cloudflare.
