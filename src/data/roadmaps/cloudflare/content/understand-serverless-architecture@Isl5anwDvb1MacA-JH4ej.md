# Understand Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture allows you to run code without managing servers, and Cloudflare Workers is a key implementation of this. With Cloudflare Workers, you deploy JavaScript/TypeScript functions to Cloudflare's edge network, where they execute in response to HTTP requests. Serverless means you don't provision or maintain servers; Cloudflare handles scaling and infrastructure. This model enables faster deployments, pay-per-use pricing, and reduced operational overhead. You focus on code, while Cloudflare handles the underlying infrastructure, making it ideal for building performant and scalable applications.
