# AI Model Integration

Workers AI provides the ability to run AI models directly on Cloudflare's edge network for recognition tasks. This includes image recognition (identifying objects or scenes in images) and natural language understanding (analyzing text for sentiment, intent, or entities). By performing AI model recognition at the edge, you can reduce latency and improve the responsiveness of AI-powered applications.
