# Edge Computing Fundamentals

Edge computing brings computation closer to the user, minimizing latency. Cloudflare Workers embodies this: your code runs on Cloudflare's global network of servers, near your users. This reduces network hops and improves response times. By executing logic at the edge, you can personalize content, filter requests, and optimize delivery without needing to route traffic back to a central server. Edge computing with Workers enables faster, more responsive applications and enhanced user experiences.
