# Caching Patterns

Caching is a critical aspect of building performant and scalable applications. Cloudflare Workers provide several caching patterns that you can use to optimize your application's performance. These patterns include:

- **Cache-First:** Serve from cache if available, otherwise fetch from origin.
- **Network-First:** Always fetch from origin, caching the response for subsequent requests.
- **Stale-While-Revalidate:** Serve from cache immediately, then update the cache in the background.

You can also manipulate HTTP cache headers (Cache-Control, Expires) to control how Cloudflare's CDN caches content. Effective caching is crucial for improving performance and reducing origin server load.
