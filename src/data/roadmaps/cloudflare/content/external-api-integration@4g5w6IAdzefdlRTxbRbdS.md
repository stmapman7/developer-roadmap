# External API Integration

Cloudflare Workers can integrate with external APIs to enrich functionality. You can use fetch() within a Worker to make requests to third-party services. This enables you to:

- Retrieve data from external sources.
- Send data to external systems.
- Authenticate with external services using API keys or tokens.

Integrating with external APIs allows you to build powerful applications that leverage the capabilities of other platforms.
