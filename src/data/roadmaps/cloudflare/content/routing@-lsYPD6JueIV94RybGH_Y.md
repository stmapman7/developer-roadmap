# Routing

In Cloudflare Email Workers, routing refers to directing incoming emails to the appropriate destination or processing logic. Email Workers intercept emails and use defined rules to determine their fate. You can route emails based on sender, recipient, subject, or other criteria. This allows you to forward emails, trigger custom logic, or even discard unwanted messages. Effective routing is critical for managing email flow, implementing custom email workflows, and building applications that react to incoming email.
