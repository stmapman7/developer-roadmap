# Video Processing

Cloudflare offers video processing capabilities through Stream and Workers:

- **Stream:** Handles encoding, transcoding, and adaptive bitrate streaming automatically.
- **Workers:** You can use Workers to intercept video requests and perform custom processing, such as adding watermarks or modifying metadata.

This allows you to customize your video delivery pipeline.
