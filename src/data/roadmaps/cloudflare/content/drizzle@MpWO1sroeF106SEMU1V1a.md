# Drizzle

Drizzle ORM is a TypeScript ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that can be used with Cloudflare D1 to provide a type-safe and more developer-friendly way to interact with your database. It allows you to define your database schema using TypeScript code and provides a query builder that helps you construct SQL queries in a type-safe manner. Drizzle can simplify database interactions, improve code maintainability, and reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities. It also supports migrations, making it easier to manage schema changes over time.
