# Edge SSL/TLS

Cloudflare's Edge SSL/TLS terminates SSL/TLS connections at Cloudflare's edge network, close to the user. This reduces latency and improves performance compared to terminating connections at the origin server. Cloudflare offers various SSL/TLS options, including:

- **Universal SSL:** Free SSL certificates for all Cloudflare users.
- **Dedicated SSL:** Custom SSL certificates for specific domains.
- **Origin CA:** Free certificates for securing communication between Cloudflare and your origin.

Edge SSL/TLS ensures secure communication between users and your website while optimizing performance.
