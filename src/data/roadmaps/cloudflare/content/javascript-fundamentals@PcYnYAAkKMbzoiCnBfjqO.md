# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It runs in the browser, allowing for client-side scripting that can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events, and interact with web APIs.

JavaScript is a core language for Cloudflare Workers, allowing you to write serverless functions that run on Cloudflare's edge network. You'll use it to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, customize website behavior, and build dynamic applications. Understanding JavaScript fundamentals like variables, functions, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), and DOM manipulation is crucial for effective Cloudflare Workers development. You can also use TypeScript, which compiles to JavaScript, offering static typing benefits.
