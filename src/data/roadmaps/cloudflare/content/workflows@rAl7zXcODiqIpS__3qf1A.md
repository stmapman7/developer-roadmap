# Workflows

Cloudflare Workflow allows you to automate tasks and orchestrate different Cloudflare services through a visual, no-code/low-code interface. You can create workflows that trigger based on various events (e.g., HTTP requests, scheduled triggers) and perform actions such as modifying HTTP headers, routing traffic, or integrating with external APIs. It's designed to simplify complex configurations and automate repetitive tasks without requiring extensive coding knowledge.
