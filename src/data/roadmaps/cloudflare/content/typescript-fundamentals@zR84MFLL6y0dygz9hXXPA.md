# TypeScript Fundamentals

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It enhances code maintainability and reduces errors by catching type-related issues during development. For Cloudflare Workers, TypeScript can improve the development experience. You define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, making code more predictable. TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript before deployment to Cloudflare Workers. Using TypeScript allows for better tooling, autocompletion, and refactoring, leading to more robust and scalable serverless applications.
