# Tunnels

Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure, outbound-only connection between your origin server and Cloudflare's network, without opening any inbound ports. This protects your origin from direct attacks and simplifies network configuration. You can use Cloudflare Tunnel to securely expose web applications, APIs, and other services to the internet, without compromising security.
