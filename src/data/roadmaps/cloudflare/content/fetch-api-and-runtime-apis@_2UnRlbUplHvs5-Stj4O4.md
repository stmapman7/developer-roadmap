# Fetch API and Runtime APIs

Within Cloudflare Workers, the Fetch API is your primary tool for making HTTP requests to external services or your origin server. It's similar to the Fetch API in browsers but adapted for the Workers environment. Runtime APIs provide access to Cloudflare-specific features like KV storage (for persistent data), Durable Objects (for stateful applications), and other services. These APIs allow Workers to interact with Cloudflare's infrastructure and build powerful applications that go beyond simple request/response handling.
