# Key-value Operations

Cloudflare Workers provide a simple API for reading and writing data to a Key-Value store. You can use the `put` method to store data, and the `get` method to retrieve it. The `delete` method allows you to remove data from the store. KV stores are ideal for storing configuration data, user sessions, and other data that needs to be accessed quickly.
