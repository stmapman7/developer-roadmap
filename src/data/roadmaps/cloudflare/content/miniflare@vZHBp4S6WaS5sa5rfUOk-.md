# Miniflare

Miniflare is a simulator for Cloudflare Workers that allows you to test your Workers locally. It mimics the Cloudflare Workers runtime environment, including features like KV storage, Durable Objects, and the Cache API. Miniflare enables rapid iteration and debugging without deploying to Cloudflare's edge network. It's a valuable tool for developing and testing Workers offline or in a controlled environment.
