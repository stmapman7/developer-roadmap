Miniflare is a local simulator for Cloudflare Workers. It mimics the Cloudflare Workers runtime environment on your local machine, allowing you to test your Workers without deploying them to Cloudflare. Miniflare supports features like KV storage, Durable Objects, and Service Bindings, making it a valuable tool for local development and debugging. It speeds up development cycles by providing a fast and reliable local testing environment.
