# Webhook Handling

Cloudflare can handle webhooks to trigger actions based on external events. You can configure Cloudflare Workers to receive webhook requests and process the data. This allows you to integrate Cloudflare with other services like GitHub, Slack, or monitoring tools. When an event occurs in the external service, it sends a webhook to your Cloudflare Worker, which can then perform actions such as updating DNS records, purging the cache, or sending notifications.
