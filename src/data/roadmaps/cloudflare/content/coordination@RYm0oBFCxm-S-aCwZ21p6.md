# Coordination

Durable Objects facilitate coordination between different clients or Workers. Because each object has a single, consistent view of its state, it can act as a central point for coordinating actions. Multiple clients can interact with the same Durable Object, and the object can ensure that actions are performed in a consistent and predictable order. This is useful for building collaborative applications where multiple users need to work on the same data.
