# Message Processing

With Cloudflare Queues, message processing involves sending messages to a queue from a producer (usually a Worker) and then consuming those messages from the queue by a consumer (another Worker or service). The consumer processes each message, performing tasks like data transformation, calling APIs, or updating databases. Queues guarantees at-least-once delivery, meaning a message will be delivered to a consumer at least once, even if there are failures. Consumers can acknowledge successful processing to remove messages from the queue.
