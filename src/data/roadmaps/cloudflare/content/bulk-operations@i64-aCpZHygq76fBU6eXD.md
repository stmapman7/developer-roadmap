# Bulk Operations

Cloudflare Workers allow you to perform bulk operations on KV stores. You can use the `batch` method to perform multiple operations in a single request. This is useful for tasks like importing data from an external source or updating multiple records at once. Bulk operations are efficient and scalable, allowing you to handle large amounts of data with ease.
