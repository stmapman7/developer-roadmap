# Prisma

Prisma is a popular open-source ORM that provides a type-safe database client and migration tools. While not directly compatible with Cloudflare D1 due to its reliance on specific database adapters, Prisma can be used in conjunction with a D1 adapter or a custom data access layer within your Cloudflare Workers. This approach allows you to leverage Prisma's type safety, query builder, and migration features while still using D1 as your database.
