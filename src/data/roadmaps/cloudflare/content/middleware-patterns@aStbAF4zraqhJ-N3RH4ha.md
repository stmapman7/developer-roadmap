# Middleware Patterns

Middleware patterns in Cloudflare Workers allow you to chain functions to process requests or responses in a modular way. Each middleware function performs a specific task (e.g., authentication, logging, header modification) before passing the request/response to the next function in the chain. This promotes code reusability, separation of concerns, and easier maintenance. By composing middleware, you can build complex request processing pipelines.
