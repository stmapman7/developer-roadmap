# Large File Handling

Handling large files on Cloudflare requires strategies to avoid exceeding size limits and ensure efficient delivery. Techniques include:

- **Streaming:** Processing files in chunks to reduce memory usage.
- **Range Requests:** Serving only the requested portion of a file.
- **Cloudflare Stream:** Using Cloudflare's video streaming service for large video files.
- **R2 integration:** Storing large files in R2 and serving them via Workers.

These methods allow you to handle large files effectively while leveraging Cloudflare's global network.
