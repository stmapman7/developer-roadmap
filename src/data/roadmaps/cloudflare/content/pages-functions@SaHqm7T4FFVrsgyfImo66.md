# Pages Functions

Pages Functions, (now part of Cloudflare Functions), allow you to run serverless code directly within your Cloudflare Pages projects. This lets you add dynamic functionality, like form handling or API endpoints, to your otherwise static sites. They're deployed alongside your static assets and execute on Cloudflare's edge network, ensuring low latency and high performance.
