# Security & Performance

Cloudflare significantly enhances both security and performance through its global network. It provides robust protection against DDoS attacks, bot traffic, and other web threats, while also accelerating website loading times via its CDN and caching mechanisms. By terminating SSL/TLS connections at the edge and optimizing content delivery, Cloudflare ensures a secure and fast experience for users, reducing latency and improving overall website resilience.

**Security:** Cloudflare Email Workers can enhance email security by:

- **Spam and Phishing Detection:** Implementing custom filters to identify and block malicious emails before they reach the recipient.
- **Content Sanitization:** Removing potentially harmful content from emails, such as malicious scripts or links.
- **Authentication:** Verifying sender authenticity to prevent spoofing and phishing attacks.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Preventing sensitive information from being sent via email.

**Performance:** Email Workers impact performance by:

- **Reduced Latency:** Processing emails closer to the user, minimizing delays.
- **Scalability:** Handling large volumes of email traffic without performance degradation.
- **Custom Routing:** Efficiently directing emails to the appropriate destination.
- **Optimized Processing:** Performing lightweight email processing tasks to avoid bottlenecks.

Effectively leveraging Email Workers for security and performance requires careful planning and implementation of relevant filters, rules, and processing logic.
