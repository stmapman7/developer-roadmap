# HTTP and Web Protocols

Understanding HTTP and web protocols is crucial for leveraging Cloudflare's features. HTTP methods (GET, POST), status codes, headers, and caching mechanisms directly influence how Cloudflare interacts with your application. Cloudflare supports modern protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, improving performance. Familiarity with TLS/SSL is vital for secure communication, and concepts like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) are relevant when handling API requests. Cloudflare's features, like caching rules and page rules, operate based on these protocols.
