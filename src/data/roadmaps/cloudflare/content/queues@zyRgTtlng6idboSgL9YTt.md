# Queues

Cloudflare Queues is a message queuing service that allows you to decouple different parts of your application. It enables you to reliably send and receive messages between Workers or other services. This asynchronous communication is useful for tasks like background processing, handling spikes in traffic, and building resilient applications. Queues ensures messages are delivered, even if the receiving service is temporarily unavailable.
