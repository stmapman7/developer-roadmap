# Web Security Headers

Web security headers are HTTP response headers that enhance website security. Cloudflare allows you to easily configure these headers to protect against common attacks. Key headers include:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Controls resources the browser can load.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enforces HTTPS connections.
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking attacks.
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Enables XSS filtering in browsers.
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls referrer information sent with requests.

Cloudflare simplifies setting these headers, improving website security with minimal effort.
