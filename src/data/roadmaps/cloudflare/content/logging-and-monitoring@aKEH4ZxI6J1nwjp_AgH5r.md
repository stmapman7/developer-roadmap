# Logging and Monitoring

Effective logging and monitoring are crucial for understanding and debugging Cloudflare Workers. You can use `console.log` for basic logging during development. For production, consider using a dedicated logging service to collect and analyze logs from your Workers. Cloudflare provides metrics like request counts, CPU usage, and error rates that can be monitored in the Cloudflare dashboard. Setting up alerts based on these metrics helps you identify and address issues quickly.
