# Bucket Operations

In Cloudflare R2, buckets are containers for storing objects. You can perform various bucket operations, including:

- **Creating Buckets:** Creating new buckets to organize your data.
- **Listing Buckets:** Listing all the buckets in your account.
- **Deleting Buckets:** Deleting buckets that are no longer needed (must be empty).
- **Configuring Bucket Policies:** Setting access control policies for buckets.

These operations are typically performed using the R2 API, the Cloudflare dashboard, or command-line tools like `wrangler`.
