# Production Efficiency

Production efficiency measures how well a manufacturing process converts inputs (like raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (finished goods). It focuses on minimizing waste, optimizing resource utilization, and streamlining workflows to produce the maximum possible output with the least amount of input. Analyzing production efficiency involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as throughput, cycle time, and defect rates to identify areas for improvement and ultimately reduce costs and increase profitability.
