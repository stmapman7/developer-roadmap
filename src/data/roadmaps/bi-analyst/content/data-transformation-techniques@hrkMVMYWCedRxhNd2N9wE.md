# Data Transformation Techniques

Data transformation techniques involve changing data from one format or structure to another. Common techniques include:

*   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting errors, and removing duplicates.
*   **Filtering:** Selecting specific data based on defined criteria.
*   **Aggregation:** Summarizing data (e.g., calculating sums, averages, counts).
*   **Joining:** Combining data from multiple sources based on related fields.
*   **Pivoting:** Rotating data to change rows into columns or vice versa.
*   **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling numerical data to a specific range.
*   **Data Type Conversion:** Changing the data type of a field (e.g., string to integer).
