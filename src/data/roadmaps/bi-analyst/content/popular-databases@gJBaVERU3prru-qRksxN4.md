# Popular Databases

Relational databases are a common way to store and organize data in tables with rows and columns. They use relationships between these tables to efficiently manage information. Some popular examples include MySQL, a widely used open-source database; PostgreSQL, known for its robustness and adherence to standards; SQLite, a lightweight database often embedded in applications; and Oracle, a commercial database known for its scalability and features.
