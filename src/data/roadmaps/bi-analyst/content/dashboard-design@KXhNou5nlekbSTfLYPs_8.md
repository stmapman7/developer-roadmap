It focuses on arranging key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and other data visualizations in a way that tells a clear and concise story about the underlying data, enabling users to quickly identify trends, patterns, and insights. Effective dashboard design prioritizes clarity, usability, and relevance to the intended audience.
