# Data Modeling for BI

Data modeling involves structuring and organizing data in a way that's optimized for reporting, analysis, and decision-making. It focuses on creating a simplified and efficient representation of data, often using techniques like star or snowflake schemas, to facilitate quick querying and insightful visualizations. The goal is to transform raw data into a format that's easily understood and readily accessible for BI tools and users.
