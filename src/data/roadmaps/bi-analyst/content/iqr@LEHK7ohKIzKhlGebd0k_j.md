# Interquartile Range (IQR)

The Interquartile Range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, representing the spread of the middle 50% of a dataset. It's calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). The IQR is resistant to outliers, making it a robust measure of variability when extreme values are present.
