# Other Data Formats

Data comes in many forms beyond the common Excel, CSV, JSON, and XML files. These formats are structured ways to store information, but other formats exist to handle different types of data. For example, you might encounter formats like Parquet and Avro, which are optimized for efficient storage and retrieval in big data environments. Databases themselves, like SQL Server or MongoDB, represent structured data formats. Image files (JPEG, PNG), audio files (MP3, WAV), and video files (MP4, MOV) are also data formats, albeit unstructured ones. Understanding the variety of data formats is crucial for accessing and integrating diverse data sources.
