# Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to determine the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It helps to understand how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another, indicating whether they tend to increase or decrease together. The correlation coefficient, typically ranging from -1 to +1, quantifies this relationship, with values closer to -1 or +1 indicating a stronger correlation and 0 indicating no linear relationship.
