# Open-Source Projects

Open-source projects are collaborative software development initiatives where the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This allows for community-driven innovation and improvement. Two popular open-source BI projects are Metabase, a user-friendly data exploration and visualization tool, and Apache Superset, a modern, enterprise-ready BI web application.
