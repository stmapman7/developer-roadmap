# Discrete vs. Continuous Variables

Discrete variables represent countable items, meaning they can only take on specific, separate values (like whole numbers). Continuous variables, on the other hand, can take on any value within a given range, including fractions and decimals. Understanding the difference is crucial for choosing the right statistical methods and interpreting data accurately.
