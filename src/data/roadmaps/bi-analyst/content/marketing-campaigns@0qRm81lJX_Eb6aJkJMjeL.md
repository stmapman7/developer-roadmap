# Marketing Campaigns

Marketing campaigns are organized efforts to promote a specific business goal, such as increasing brand awareness, driving sales, or launching a new product. These campaigns involve a series of coordinated activities, including advertising, promotions, content creation, and customer engagement, all designed to reach a target audience and achieve measurable results. The success of a marketing campaign is typically evaluated based on key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates, return on investment (ROI), and customer acquisition cost (CAC).
