Dispersion measures offers a crucial way to understand the variability or spread in a set of data. Distinct measures of dispersion such as range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range gives BI analysts insight into how spread out data points are, and how reliable any patterns detected may be. This understanding of dispersion helps data analysts in identifying outliers, drawing meaningful conclusions, and making informed predictions.
