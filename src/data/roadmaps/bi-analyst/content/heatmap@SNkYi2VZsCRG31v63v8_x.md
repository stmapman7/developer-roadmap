# Heatmaps

A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted using color. It allows you to quickly identify patterns, correlations, and variations in large datasets by representing data points as colored cells in a matrix. The color intensity typically corresponds to the magnitude of the value, making it easy to spot high and low values at a glance.
