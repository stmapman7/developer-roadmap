# Population & Sample

In statistics, a population refers to the entire group you want to draw conclusions about, while a sample is a smaller, manageable subset of that population that you actually collect data from. Because it's often impractical or impossible to study an entire population, we use samples to make inferences or generalizations about the larger group. The goal is to ensure the sample is representative of the population so that the conclusions drawn from the sample data are accurate and reliable for the entire population.
