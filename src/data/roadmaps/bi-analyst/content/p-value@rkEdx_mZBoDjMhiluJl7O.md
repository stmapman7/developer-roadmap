# P-Value

The p-value is a number that tells you how likely it is that your data could have occurred under the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one computed from your sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis. A large p-value (> 0.05) suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
