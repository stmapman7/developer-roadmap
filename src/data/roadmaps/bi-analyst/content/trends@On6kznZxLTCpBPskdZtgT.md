# Trends in Time Series Analysis

Trends in time series analysis refer to the long-term movement or direction of data points in a dataset over a period of time. Identifying trends helps to understand the underlying patterns and predict future values. These trends can be upward (increasing), downward (decreasing), or stationary (relatively constant) and are often analyzed to make informed decisions and forecasts.
