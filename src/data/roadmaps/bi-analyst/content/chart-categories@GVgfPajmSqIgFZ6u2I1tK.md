# Chart Categories

Charts are visual representations of data, used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. They generally fall into a few main categories: **comparison** charts (like bar charts and column charts) which show differences between values; **relationship** charts (such as scatter plots) that reveal correlations between variables; **composition** charts (like pie charts and stacked area charts) which display parts of a whole; and **distribution** charts (histograms and box plots) that illustrate the spread and frequency of data. Choosing the right chart type depends on the data you have and the story you want to tell.
