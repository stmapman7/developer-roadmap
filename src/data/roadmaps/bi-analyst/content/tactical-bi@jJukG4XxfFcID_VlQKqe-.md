# Tactical BI

Tactical planning is responsible for establishing goals and conditions for the actions to be carried out outlined in strategic planning. Moreover, assessing and monitoring risks to address them effectively is essential.

While strategic planning covers the entire organization, tactical planning operates on a more limited scale. It is implemented at the departmental level, sometimes focusing on specific end-to-end processes, and usually covers a period of 1 to 3 years.
