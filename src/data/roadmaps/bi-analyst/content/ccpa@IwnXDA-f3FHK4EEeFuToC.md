# CCPA

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a California state law that grants consumers specific rights regarding their personal information held by businesses. These rights include the right to know what personal information is being collected about them, the right to request deletion of their personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. CCPA aims to give consumers more control over their data and increase transparency in data handling practices.
