# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. It's used to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. The goal of EDA is to gain a deeper understanding of the data before formal modelling or hypothesis testing.
