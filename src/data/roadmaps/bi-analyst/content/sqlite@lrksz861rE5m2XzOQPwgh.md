# SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is designed for simplicity and efficiency. It is widely used in embedded systems and applications where a full-featured database server is not required, such as mobile apps, desktop applications, and small to medium-sized websites. SQLite stores data in a single file, which makes it easy to deploy and manage. It supports standard SQL queries and provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance to ensure data integrity. SQLiteâ€™s small footprint, minimal configuration, and ease of use make it a popular choice for applications needing a compact, high-performance database solution.
