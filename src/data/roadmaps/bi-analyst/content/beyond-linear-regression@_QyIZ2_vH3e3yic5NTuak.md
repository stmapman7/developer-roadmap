# Beyond Linear Regression

 While linear regressions are widely popular in predictive modelling, they don't always work. Fortunately,  there's a wide array of statistical methods that can be to model relationships between variables when the assumption of a linear relationship is not appropriate. These techniques, such as polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and logistic regression allow for capturing more complex and non-linear patterns in data, leading to more accurate predictions and insights. They are essential when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables curves or changes direction.
