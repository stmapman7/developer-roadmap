# Writing Executive Summaries

Executive summaries are concise overviews of longer reports or analyses, designed to quickly inform decision-makers. The best executive summaries clearly state the problem or opportunity, the key findings, the recommended actions, and the expected benefits. They should be brief, typically no more than one page, and written in plain language, avoiding technical jargon. Prioritize clarity and focus on the most important information, ensuring the summary is easily understood and actionable.
