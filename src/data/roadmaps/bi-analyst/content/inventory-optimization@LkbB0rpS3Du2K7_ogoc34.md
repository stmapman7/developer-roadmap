# Inventory Optimization

Inventory optimization is the process of strategically managing and controlling the flow of goods to minimize costs while meeting customer demand. It involves analyzing historical sales data, forecasting future demand, and considering factors like lead times, storage costs, and potential obsolescence to determine the optimal quantity of each product to keep in stock. The goal is to strike a balance between avoiding stockouts and minimizing excess inventory, ultimately improving profitability and customer satisfaction.
