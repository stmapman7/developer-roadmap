# Statistical Tests

Statistical tests are methods used to determine if there's enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. They help us decide whether observed differences or relationships in data are likely due to a real effect or simply due to random chance. These tests involve calculating a test statistic and comparing it to a critical value or calculating a p-value to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. The choice of a specific statistical test, like a t-test or chi-square test, depends on the research design, data type (e.g., normal distribution), and the variables being analyzed.
