# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable format for storing and transporting data. It uses a text-based format to represent data objects as attribute-value pairs and arrays, making it easy for both humans and machines to parse and generate. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending data from a server to a web browser) and is supported by many programming languages.
