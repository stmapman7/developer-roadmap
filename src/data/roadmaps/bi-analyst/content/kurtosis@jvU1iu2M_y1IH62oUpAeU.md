# Kurtosis

Kurtosis is a statistical measure of a probability distribution's "tailedness," indicating the extent to which extreme values (outliers) are present compared to a normal distribution. It assesses the presence of both peakedness and heavy/light tails, categorizing distributions as leptokurtic (heavy, long tails and a sharp peak), platykurtic (light, short tails and a flat top), or mesokurtic (similar to a normal distribution).
