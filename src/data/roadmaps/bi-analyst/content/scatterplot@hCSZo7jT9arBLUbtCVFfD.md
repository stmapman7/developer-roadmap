# Scatterplot

A scatterplot is a type of data visualization that uses dots to represent values for two different variables. Each dot's position on the horizontal and vertical axes indicates the values for an individual data point. Scatterplots are primarily used to observe and display the relationship or correlation between these two variables, revealing patterns, clusters, and outliers in the data.
