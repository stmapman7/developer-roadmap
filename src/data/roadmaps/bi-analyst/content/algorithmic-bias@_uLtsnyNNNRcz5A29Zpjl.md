# Algorithmic Bias

Algorithmic bias occurs when a computer system reflects the implicit values of the humans who created the algorithm or the data used to train it. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes for certain groups of people, even if the algorithm is not explicitly designed to be biased. It arises from flawed assumptions, incomplete data, or biased data used in the development process, ultimately perpetuating and amplifying existing societal biases.
