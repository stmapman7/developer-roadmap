# Skewness

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images. A distribution can have right (or positive), left (or negative), or zero skewness, where the tails are roughly equal. A right-skewed distribution is longer on the right side of its peak, and a left-skewed distribution is longer on the left side of its peak. This measure helps understand data structure, the presence of outliers, and its suitability for statistical analyses.
