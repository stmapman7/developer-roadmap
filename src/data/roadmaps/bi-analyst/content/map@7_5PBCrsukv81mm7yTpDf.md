# Maps in Data Visualization

Maps are visual representations of geographical data, used to display information across different locations. They allow you to see spatial patterns and relationships, such as population density, sales distribution, or resource locations. Different types of maps, like choropleth maps (using color shading) or point maps (using markers), can highlight specific aspects of the data and provide valuable insights based on location.
