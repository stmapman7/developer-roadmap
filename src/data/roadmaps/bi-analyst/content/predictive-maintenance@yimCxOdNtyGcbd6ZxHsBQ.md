# Predictive Maintenance

Predictive maintenance uses data analysis and machine learning to forecast when equipment failures are likely to occur. This allows manufacturers to schedule maintenance proactively, minimizing downtime and reducing costs associated with unexpected breakdowns. By analyzing sensor data, historical maintenance records, and other relevant information, predictive maintenance models can identify patterns and anomalies that indicate potential problems before they lead to significant disruptions.
