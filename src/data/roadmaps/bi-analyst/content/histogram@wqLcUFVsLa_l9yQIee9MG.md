# Histogram

A histogram is a type of bar chart that visually represents the distribution of numerical data. It groups data into bins (or intervals) and displays the frequency (or count) of data points falling within each bin. This allows you to quickly understand the underlying frequency distribution, identify patterns like skewness or outliers, and gain insights into the central tendency and spread of the data.
