# ETL Basics

ETL, which stands for Extract, Transform, and Load, is a process used to move data from various source systems into a data warehouse or other data repository. It involves extracting data from different sources, transforming it into a consistent and usable format, and then loading it into the target system for analysis and reporting. This process ensures data quality and consistency, making it easier to derive meaningful insights.
