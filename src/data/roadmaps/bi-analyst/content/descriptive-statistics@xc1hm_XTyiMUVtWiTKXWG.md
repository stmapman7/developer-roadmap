# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are methods used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. This involves calculating measures like mean, median, and mode to represent central tendency, as well as measures like standard deviation and range to describe the spread or variability of the data. These techniques help to gain initial insights into the data's distribution and characteristics without making inferences beyond the observed sample.
