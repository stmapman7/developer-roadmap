# Data Formats

Data formats define the structure in which data is stored and organized. These formats dictate how information is encoded, interpreted, and used by different systems and applications. Common examples include CSV (Comma Separated Values) for tabular data, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for structured data, and XML (Extensible Markup Language) for hierarchical data. Understanding data formats is crucial for effectively extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data, as well as for ensuring data compatibility and integrity across various platforms.
