# Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis is a behavioral analytics technique that groups users with shared characteristics over a specific time span. These groups, or cohorts, are then tracked and compared to understand how their behavior evolves over time. This helps identify patterns, trends, and insights related to user engagement, retention, and other key metrics.
