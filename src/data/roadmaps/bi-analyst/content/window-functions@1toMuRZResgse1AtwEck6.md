# Window Functions

Window functions in SQL perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions that group rows into a single output row, window functions retain the individual rows while adding calculated values based on the window frame defined for each row. This allows you to compute things like running totals, moving averages, or rank values within a partition of your data without collapsing the original dataset.
