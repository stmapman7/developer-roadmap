# Operational BI

Operational planning is the starting point for implementing the actions and goals outlined by tactical planning; aiming to achieve the objectives established in strategic decisions. Operational planning focuses on short-term activities, typically with a 3-6 month horizon. All sectors of the organization are involved in this process, dedicating themselves to monitoring daily activities to ensure execution.
