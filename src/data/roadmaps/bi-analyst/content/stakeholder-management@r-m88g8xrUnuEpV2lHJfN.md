# Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management involves identifying individuals or groups who have an interest in a project or business outcome and then developing strategies to effectively communicate with and manage their expectations. This includes understanding their needs, addressing their concerns, and ensuring their involvement throughout the project lifecycle to achieve successful results and maintain positive relationships.
