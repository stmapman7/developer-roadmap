# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It aims to find the best-fitting line (in simple linear regression) or plane (in multiple linear regression) that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. This allows for predicting future values or understanding the influence of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
