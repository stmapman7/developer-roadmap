# XML

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It uses tags to define elements and attributes to describe the properties of those elements, allowing for structured data representation and exchange between different systems and applications. XML's hierarchical structure makes it suitable for representing complex data relationships.
