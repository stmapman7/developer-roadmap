# Standard Deviation (STD)

The sample standard deviation is a statistical measure used to quantify the variation within a dataset. Specifically, it tells us how much individual data points in a sample differ from the sample mean. It's calculated as the square root of the variance. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points are generally close to the mean, while a high standard deviation implies that the data points are spread out over a wider range
