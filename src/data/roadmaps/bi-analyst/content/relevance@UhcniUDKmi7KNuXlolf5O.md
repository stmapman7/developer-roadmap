# Relevance

Relevance, in the context of data quality, refers to the degree to which data is useful and applicable for its intended purpose. Data is considered relevant if it directly addresses the needs of the analysis or decision-making process it's being used for. Irrelevant data can lead to inaccurate insights, wasted resources, and ultimately, poor business outcomes.
