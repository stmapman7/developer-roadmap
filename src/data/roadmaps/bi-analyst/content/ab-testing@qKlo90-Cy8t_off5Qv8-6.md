# A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of something to determine which one performs better. This is done by showing the two versions (A and B) to similar audiences and measuring which version achieves a specific goal, such as a higher click-through rate or conversion rate. The version that performs better is then implemented.
