# Data Lineage

Data lineage is the process of understanding and documenting the journey of data, from its origin to its destination. It tracks how data is transformed, moved, and used throughout its lifecycle. This includes identifying the sources of data, the transformations applied to it (e.g., cleaning, aggregation), and the systems and users that access or modify it.
