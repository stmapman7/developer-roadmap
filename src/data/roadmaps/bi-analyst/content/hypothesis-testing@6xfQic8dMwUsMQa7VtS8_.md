# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for an entire population. It involves formulating a null hypothesis (a statement of no effect or no difference) and an alternative hypothesis (a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis), then using sample data to assess the likelihood of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true. Based on this likelihood, a decision is made to either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
