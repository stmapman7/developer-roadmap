# ETL Tools

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools are software applications used to move data from various source systems into a data warehouse or other target system. These tools extract data from different sources, transform it into a consistent and usable format, and then load it into the destination system for analysis and reporting. This process ensures data quality and consistency, making it easier for business intelligence analysts to derive meaningful insights.
