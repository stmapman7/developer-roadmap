# Types of Errors

In hypothesis testing, a Type I error (false positive) occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, while a Type II error (false negative) happens when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. These are the two types of mistakes that can be made when deciding whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis, with their probabilities denoted by alpha (α) and beta (β), respectively.
