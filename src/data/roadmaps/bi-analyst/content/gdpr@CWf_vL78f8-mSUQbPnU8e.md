# GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union law focused on protecting the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It dictates how organizations collect, use, and store personal information, giving individuals more control over their data and imposing strict rules on data processing activities. GDPR aims to standardize data protection laws across Europe and applies to any organization that processes the personal data of EU residents, regardless of the organization's location.
