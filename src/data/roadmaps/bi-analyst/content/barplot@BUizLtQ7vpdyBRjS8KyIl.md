# Barplots

A barplot, also known as a bar chart or bar graph, is a visual representation of data that uses rectangular bars to compare different categories or groups. The length or height of each bar corresponds to the value it represents, allowing for easy comparison of quantities across different categories. Barplots can be oriented vertically (column charts) or horizontally (bar charts), and are commonly used to display frequencies, averages, or other summary statistics.
