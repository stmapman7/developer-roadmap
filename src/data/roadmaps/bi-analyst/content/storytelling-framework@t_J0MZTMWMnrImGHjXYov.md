A storytelling framework provides a structured approach to crafting narratives from data insights. It typically involves defining the audience, identifying the key message, structuring the narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and using visuals to support the story. This framework helps to present data in a compelling and easily understandable way, ensuring the audience grasps the significance of the findings.
