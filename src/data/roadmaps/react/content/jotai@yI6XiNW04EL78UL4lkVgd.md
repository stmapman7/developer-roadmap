# Jotai

Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management.

Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context, eliminates the need for memoization, and provides a similar developer experience to signals while maintaining a declarative programming model.

It scales from a simple useState replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and extensions to help you along the way!
