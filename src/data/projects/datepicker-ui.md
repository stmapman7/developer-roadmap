In this project, you are required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to help you practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing the datepicker UI you need to create.

Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, and overall design to match your style.

While this version won't be functional, it will provide a solid foundation for creating an interactive datepicker in a future project.
