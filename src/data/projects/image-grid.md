In this project, you are required to create a grid layout using HTML and CSS. You will be provided with six images that need to be arranged in a grid pattern based on the provided mockup. The primary focus of this project is to help you learn and practice the CSS Grid layout technique, which is essential for creating responsive and flexible web layouts.

The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience with CSS Grid, allowing you to create complex layouts with ease. Below is a rough mockup showing the grid layout you need to create along with the six images that you should use.

You can use the same images provided in the mockup or replace them with your own images. The grid layout should be responsive, meaning it should adapt to different screen sizes and maintain a visually appealing design.
