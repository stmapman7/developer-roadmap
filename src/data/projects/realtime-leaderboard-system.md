This project involves creating a backend system for a real-time leaderboard service. The service will allow users to compete in various games or activities, track their scores, and view their rankings on a leaderboard. The system will feature user authentication, score submission, real-time leaderboard updates, and score history tracking. Redis sorted sets will be used to manage and query the leaderboards efficiently.

## Project Requirements

You are to build an imaginary real-time leaderboard system that ranks users based on their scores in various games or activities. The system should meet the following requirements:

1. **User Authentication**: Users should be able to register and log in to the system.
2. **Score Submission**: Users should be able to submit their scores for different games or activities.
3. **Leaderboard Updates**: Display a global leaderboard showing the top users across all games.
4. **User Rankings**: Users should be able to view their rankings on the leaderboard.
5. **Top Players Report:** Generate reports on the top players for a specific period.

## Tip - Use Redis Sorted Sets

- **Leaderboard Storage:** Use Redis sorted sets to store and manage leaderboards.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Utilize Redis sorted sets for efficient real-time updates and queries.
- **Rank Queries:** Use Redis commands to query user ranks and leaderboard positions.

<hr />

After finishing this project, you will have a good understanding of how to create a real-time leaderboard system that updates scores in real-time. You will also gain experience working with Redis sorted sets and implementing user authentication and score submission features.
