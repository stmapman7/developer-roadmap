This project is designed to introduce you to basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Many websites display a cookie consent popup to inform users about the use of cookies and to obtain their consent. In this project, you will create a simple cookie consent popup that appears when the user visits the page. The popup will include a message and a button to accept the consent. Once accepted, the popup will disappear. Given below is an example of how the popup might look:

Bonus points if you persist the user's consent using cookies or local storage and prevent the popup from appearing on subsequent visits.
