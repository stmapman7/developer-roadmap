Each DevOps team should define this list within the context of their own project, however, a good rule of thumb is to consider the following metrics:

1. **Build Success Rate**: The percentage of successful builds versus failed builds. A low success rate indicates issues in code quality or pipeline configuration.
2. **Build Time**: The time it takes to complete a build. Monitoring build time helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the pipeline for faster feedback.
3. **Deployment Frequency**: How often deployments occur. Frequent deployments indicate a smooth pipeline, while long gaps may signal issues with your CI/CD or with the actual dev workflow.
4. **Lead Time for Changes**: The time from code commit to production deployment. Shorter lead times are preferable, indicating an efficient pipeline.
5. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: The average time it takes to recover from a failure. A lower MTTR indicates a resilient pipeline that can quickly address and fix issues.
6. **Test Coverage and Success Rate**: The percentage of code covered by automated tests and the success rate of those tests. High coverage and success rates are good indicators of better quality and reliability.
7. **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that result in failures. A lower change failure rate indicates a stable and reliable deployment process.
