A build pipeline is an automated process that compiles, tests, and prepares code for deployment. It typically involves multiple stages, such as source code retrieval, code compilation, running unit tests, performing static code analysis, creating build artifacts, and deploying to one of the available environments.

The build pipeline effectively removes humans from the deployment process as much as possible, clearly reducing the chance of human error. This, in turn, ensures consistency and reliability in software builds and speeds up the development and deployment process.
