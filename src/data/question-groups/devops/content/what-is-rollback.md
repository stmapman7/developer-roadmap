A rollback is the process of reverting a system to a previous stable state, typically after a failed or problematic deployment to production.

You would perform a rollback when a new deployment causes one or several of the following problems: application crashes, significant bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance problems.

The goal is to restore the system to a known “good” state while minimizing downtime and the impact on users while investigating and resolving the issues with the new deployment.
