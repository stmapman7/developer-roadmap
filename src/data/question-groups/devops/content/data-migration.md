Handling data migrations in a continuous deployment pipeline is not a trivial task. It requires careful planning to ensure that the application remains functional and data integrity is maintained throughout the process. Hereâ€™s an approach:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that any database schema changes are backward compatible. This means that the old application version should still work with the new schema. For example, if you're adding a new column, ensure the application can handle cases where this column might be null initially.
2. **Migration Scripts**: Write database migration scripts that are idempotent (meaning that they can be run multiple times without causing issues) and can be safely executed during the deployment process. Use a tool like Flyway or Liquibase to manage these migrations.
3. **Separate Deployment Phases**:
- **Phase 1 - Schema Migration**: Deploy the database migration scripts first, adding new columns, tables, or indexes without removing or altering existing structures that the current application relies on.
- **Phase 2 - Application Deployment**: Deploy the application code that utilizes the new schema. This ensures that the application is ready to work with the updated database structure.
- **Phase 3 - Cleanup (Optional)**: After verifying that the new application version is stable, you can deploy a cleanup script to remove or alter deprecated columns, tables, or other schema elements. While optional, this step is advised, as it helps reduce the chances of creating a build up of technical debt for future developers to deal with.
4. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to roll out new features that depend on the data migration. This allows you to deploy the new application code without immediately activating the new features, providing an additional safety net.

That said, an important, non-technical step that should also be taken into consideration is the coordination with stakeholders, particularly if the migration is complex or requires downtime. Clear communication ensures that everyone is aware of the risks and the planned steps.
