A canary release is a common and well-known deployment strategy. It works this way: when a  new version of an application is ready, instead of deploying it and making it available to everyone, you gradually roll it out to a small subset of users or servers before being released to the entire production environment.

This way, you can test the new version in a real-world environment with minimal risk. If the canary release performs well and no issues are detected, the deployment is gradually expanded to a larger audience until it eventually reaches 100% of the users. If, on the other hand, problems are found, the release can be quickly rolled back with minimal impact.
