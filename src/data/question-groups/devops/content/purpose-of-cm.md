When organizations and platforms grow large enough, keeping track of how different areas of the IT ecosystem (infrastructure, deployment pipelines, hardware, etc) are meant to be configured becomes a problem, and finding a way to manage that chaos suddenly becomes a necessity.
That is where configuration management comes into play.

The purpose of a configuration management tool is to automate the process of managing and maintaining the consistency of software and hardware configurations across an organization's infrastructure.

It makes sure that systems are configured correctly, updates are applied uniformly, and configurations are maintained according to predefined standards.

This helps reduce configuration errors, increase efficiency, and ensure that environments are consistent and compliant.
