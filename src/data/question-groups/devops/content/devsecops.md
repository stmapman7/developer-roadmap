To implement security in a DevOps pipeline (DevSecOps), you should integrate security practices throughout the development and deployment process. This is not just about securing the app once itâ€™s in production, this is about securing the entire application-creation process.

That includes:

1. **Shift Left Security**: Incorporate security early in the development process by integrating security checks in the CI/CD pipeline. This means performing static code analysis, dependency scanning, and secret detection during the build phase.
2. **[Automated Testing](https://roadmap.sh/devops/test-automation)**: Implement automated security tests, such as vulnerability scans and dynamic application security testing (DAST), to identify potential security issues before they reach production.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor the pipeline and the deployed applications for security incidents using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and specialized security monitoring tools.
4. **Infrastructure as Code - Security**: Ensure that infrastructure configurations defined in code are secure by scanning IaC templates (like Terraform) for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (like hardcoded passwords).
5. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls, using something like role-based access control (RBAC) or ABAC (attribute-based access control) and enforcing the principle of least privilege across the pipeline.
6. **Compliance Checks**: Figure out the compliance requirements and regulations of your industry and integrate those checks to ensure the pipeline adheres to industry standards and regulatory requirements.
7. **Incident Response**: Figure out a clear incident response plan and integrate security alerts into the pipeline to quickly address potential security breaches.
