Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control systems (usually Git). This helps catch issues early and improves code quality.

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) goes a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the CI process, ensuring that software updates are delivered to users quickly and efficiently without manual intervention.

Combined, they add a great deal of stability and agility to the development lifecycle.
