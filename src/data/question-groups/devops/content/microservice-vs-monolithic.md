![Microservice vs Monolithic](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/microservice-vs-monolith-2og84.png)

A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services (hence the term “micro”).

Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.

In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.

On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.

The biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.
