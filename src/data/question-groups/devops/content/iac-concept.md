![Explain the concept of IaC](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-fbhi6.png)

IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is all about managing infrastructure through code, instead of using other more conventional configuration methods. Specifically in the context of Terraform, here is how youâ€™d want to approach IaC:

- **Configuration Files**: Define your infrastructure using HCL or JSON files.
- **Execution Plan**: Generate a plan showing the changes needed to reach the desired state.
- **Resource Provisioning**: Terraform will then apply the plan to provision and configure desired resources.
- **State Management**: Terraform then tracks the current state of your infrastructure with a state file.
- **Version Control**: Finally, store the configuration files in a version control system to easily version them and share them with other team members.
