As a DevOps engineer, the concept of continuous monitoring should be ingrained in your brain as a must-perform activity.

You see, continuous monitoring is the practice of constantly overseeing and analyzing an IT system's performance, security, and compliance in real-time.

It involves collecting and assessing data from various parts of the infrastructure to detect issues, security threats, and performance bottlenecks as soon as they occur.

The goal is to ensure the system's health, security, and compliance, enabling quick responses to potential problems and maintaining the overall stability and reliability of the environment. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, and Splunk are commonly used for continuous monitoring.
