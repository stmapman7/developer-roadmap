This is probably one of the most common DevOps interview questions out there because by answering it correctly, you show that you actually know what DevOps engineers (A.K.A “you”) are supposed to work on.

That said, this is not a trivial question to answer because different companies will likely implement DevOps with their own “flavor” and in their own way.

At a high level, the role of a DevOps engineer is to bridge the gap between development and operations teams with the aim of improving the development lifecycle and reducing deployment errors.

With that said other key responsibilities may include:

- Implementing and managing CI/CD pipelines.
- Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration using IaC tools.
- Monitoring and maintaining system performance, security, and availability.
- Collaborating with developers to streamline code deployments and ensures smooth operations.
- Managing and optimizing cloud infrastructure.
- Ensuring system scalability and reliability.
- Troubleshooting and resolving issues across the development and production environments.
