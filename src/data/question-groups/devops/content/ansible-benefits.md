As an open-source tool for configuration management, Ansible provides several benefits when added to your project:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use with simple YAML syntax.
- **Agentless**: No need to install agents on managed nodes; instead it uses SSH to communicate with them.
- **Scalability**: Can manage a large number of servers simultaneously with minimum effort.
- **Integration**: Ansible integrates well with various cloud providers, CI/CD tools, and infrastructure.
- **Modularity**: [Extensive library](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html) of modules for different tasks.
- **Reusability**: Ansible playbooks and roles can be reused and shared across projects.
