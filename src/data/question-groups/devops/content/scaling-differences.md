![Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling-dfy6m.png)

Theyâ€™re both valid scaling techniques, but they both have different limitations on the affected system.

**Horizontal Scaling**

- Involves adding more machines or instances to your infrastructure.
- Increases capacity by connecting multiple hardware or software entities so they work as a single logical unit.
- Often used in distributed systems and cloud environments.

**Vertical Scaling**

- Involves adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing machine.
- Increases capacity by enhancing the power of a single server or instance.
- Limited by the maximum capacity of the hardware.

In summary, horizontal scaling adds more machines to handle increased load, while vertical scaling enhances the power of existing machines.
