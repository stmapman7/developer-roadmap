![Explain Infrastructure as Code](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-explained-4dpxm.png)

IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files (in other words, “code”), rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

By keeping this configuration in code format, we now gain the ability to keep it stored in version control platforms, and automate their deployment consistently across environments, reducing the risk of human error and increasing efficiency in infrastructure management.
