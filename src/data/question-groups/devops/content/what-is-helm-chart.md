A Helm chart is a set of YAML templates used to configure Kubernetes resources. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications within a Kubernetes cluster by bundling all necessary components (such as deployments, services, and configurations) into a single, reusable package.

Helm charts are used in Kubernetes to:

- **Simplify Deployments**: By using Helm charts, you can deploy complex applications with a single command.
- **Version Control**: Given how theyâ€™re just plain-text files, helm charts support versioning, allowing you to track and roll back to previous versions of your applications easily.
- **Configuration Management**: They allow you to manage configuration values separately from the Kubernetes manifests, making it easier to update and maintain configurations.
- **Reuse and Share**: Helm charts can be reused and shared across different projects and teams, promoting best practices and consistency.
