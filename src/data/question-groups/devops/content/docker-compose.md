[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is, in fact, a tool designed to simplify the definition and management of multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define, configure, and run multiple containers as a single service using a single YAML file.

In a multi-container application, Compose provides the following key roles:

1. **Service Definition**: With Compose you can specify multiple services inside a single file, you can also define how each service should be built, the networks they should connect to, and the volumes they should use (if any).
2. **Orchestration**: It manages the startup, shutdown, and scaling of services, ensuring that containers are launched in the correct order based on the defined dependencies.
3. **Environment Management**: Docker Compose simplifies environment configuration because it lets you set environment variables, networking configurations, and volume mounts in the docker-compose.yml file.
4. **Simplified Commands**:  All of the above can be done with a very simple set of commands you can run directly from the terminal (i.e. docker-compose up, or docker-compose down).

In the end, Docker Compose simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of multi-container applications by giving you, as a user, an extremely friendly and powerful interface.
