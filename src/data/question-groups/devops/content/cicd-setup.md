Setting up a CI/CD pipeline from scratch involves several steps. Assuming you’ve already set up your project on a version control system, and everyone in your team has proper access to it, then the next steps would help:

1. **Set up the Continuous Integration (CI)**:
- Select a continuous integration tool (there are many, like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), pick one).
- Connect the CI tool to your version control system.
- Write a build script that defines the build process, including steps like code checkout, dependency installation, compiling the code, and running tests.
- Set up automated testing to run on every code commit or pull request.

2. **Artifact Storage**:
- Decide where to store build artifacts (it could be Docker Hub, AWS S3 or anywhere you can then reference from the CD pipeline).
- Configure the pipeline to package and upload artifacts to the storage after a successful build.

3. **Set up your Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
- Choose a CD tool or extend your CI tool (same deal as before, there are many options, pick one).
Define deployment scripts that specify how to deploy your application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Configure the CD tool to trigger deployments after successful builds and tests.
- Set up environment-specific configurations and secrets management.
Remember that this system should be able to pull the artifacts from the continuous integration pipeline, so set up that access as well.

4. **Infrastructure Setup**:
- Provision infrastructure using IaC tools (e.g., [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)).
- Ensure environments are consistent and reproducible to reduce times if there is a need to create new ones or destroy and recreate existing ones. This should be as easy as executing a command without any human intervention.

5. **Set up your monitoring and logging solutions**:
- Implement monitoring and logging for your applications and infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
- Remember to configure alerts for critical issues. Otherwise, you’re missing a key aspect of monitoring (reacting to problems).

6. **Security and Compliance**:
- By now, it’s a good idea to think about integrating security scanning tools into your pipeline (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check).
- Ensure compliance with relevant standards and practices depending on your specific project’s needs.

Additionally, as a good practice,  you might also want to document the CI/CD process, pipeline configuration, and deployment steps. This is to train new team members on using and maintaining the pipelines you just created.
