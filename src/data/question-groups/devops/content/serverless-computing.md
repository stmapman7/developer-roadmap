Contrary to popular belief, serverless computing doesn’t mean there are no servers, in fact, there are, however, you just don’t need to worry about them.

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code. In this model, you don't have to manage servers or worry about scaling, as the cloud provider dynamically allocates resources as needed.

One of the great qualities of this model is that you pay only for the compute time your code actually uses, rather than for pre-allocated infrastructure (like you would for a normal server).
