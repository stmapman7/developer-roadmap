The process is pretty much the same as it was described above, with an added step to set up the actual Kubernetes cluster:

Use Terraform to define and provision Kubernetes clusters in each cloud. For instance, create an EKS cluster on AWS, an AKS cluster on Azure, and a GKE cluster on Google Cloud, specifying configurations such as node types, sizes, and networking.

Once youâ€™re ready, make sure to set up the Kubernetes auto-scaler on each of the cloud providers to manage resources and scale based on the load they receive.
