Having high availability in your system means that the cluster will always be accessible, even if one or more servers are down.

While disaster recovery means having the ability to continue providing service even in the face of a regional network outage (when multiple sections of the world are rendered unreachable).

To ensure high availability and disaster recovery in a cloud environment, you can follow these strategies if they apply to your particular context:

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: If available, deploy your application across multiple geographic regions to ensure that if one region fails, others can take over, minimizing downtime.
- **Redundancy**: Keep redundant resources, such as multiple instances, databases, and storage systems, across different availability zones within a region to avoid single points of failure.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling to automatically adjust resource capacity in response to demand, ensuring the application remains available even under high load.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement continuous monitoring and set up alerts to detect and respond to potential issues before they lead to downtime. Use tools like CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Monitoring.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Make sure to set up automated failover mechanisms to switch to backup systems or regions seamlessly in case of a failure in the primary systems.

Whatever strategy (or combination of) you decide to go with, always develop and regularly test a disaster recovery plan that outlines steps for restoring services and data in the event of a major failure.

This plan should include defined RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) targets. Being prepared to deal with the worst case scenarios is the only way, as these types of problems tend to cause chaos in small and big companies alike.
