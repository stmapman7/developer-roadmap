![What is Kubernetes](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/kubernetes-logo-with-docker-4f0q6.png)

If weâ€™re talking about DevOps tools, then Kubernetes is a must-have. Specifically, Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. That means it can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It is widely used because it simplifies the complex tasks of managing containers for large-scale applications, such as ensuring high availability, load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing.

Kubernetes helps organizations run and manage applications more efficiently and reliably in various environments, including on-premises, cloud, or hybrid setups.
