![Common IaC Tools](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-tools-oyapx.png)

As usual, there are several options out there, some of them specialized in different aspects of IaC.

**Configuration management tools**

If you’re in search of effective configuration management tools to streamline and automate your IT infrastructure, you might consider exploring the following popular options:

- Ansible
- Chef
- Puppet

Configuration management tools are designed to help DevOps engineers manage and maintain consistent configurations across multiple servers and environments. These tools automate the process of configuring, deploying, and managing systems, ensuring that your infrastructure remains reliable, scalable, and compliant with your organization's standards.

**Provisioning and orchestration tools**

If, on the other hand, you’re looking for tools to handle provisioning and orchestration of your infrastructure, you might want to explore the following popular options:

- Terraform
- CloudFormation (AWS)
- Pulumi

Provisioning and orchestration tools are essential for automating the process of setting up and managing your infrastructure resources. These tools allow you to define your IaC, making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale resources across cloud environments.

Finally, if you’re looking for multi-purpose tools, you can try something like:

- Ansible (can also be used for provisioning)
- Pulumi (supports both IaC and configuration management)
