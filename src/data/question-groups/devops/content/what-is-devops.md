DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its main goal is to shorten (and simplify) the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

It is important because it helps to improve collaboration between development and operations teams which in turn, translates into increasing deployment frequency, reducing failure rates of new releases, and speeding up recovery time.
