While in theory microservices can solve all platform problems, in practice there are several challenges that you might encounter along the way.

Some examples are:

1. **Complexity**: Managing multiple services increases the overall system complexity, making development, deployment, and monitoring more challenging (as there are more “moving parts”).
2. **Service Communication**: Ensuring reliable communication between services, handling network latency, and dealing with issues like service discovery and API versioning can be difficult. There are of course alternatives to deal with all of these issues, but they’re not evident right off the bat nor the same for everyone.
3. **Data Management**: It’s all about trade-offs in the world of distributed computing. Managing data consistency and transactions across distributed services is complex, often requiring techniques like eventual consistency and distributed databases.
4. **Deployment Overhead**: Coordinating the deployment of multiple services, especially when they have interdependencies, can lead to more complex CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Monitoring and Debugging**: Troubleshooting issues is harder in a microservices architecture due to the distributed nature of the system. Trying to figure out where the information goes and which services are involved in a single request can be quite a challenge for large platforms. This makes debugging microservices architecture a real headache.
6. **Security**: Securing microservices involves managing authentication, authorization, and data protection across multiple services, often with varying security requirements.
