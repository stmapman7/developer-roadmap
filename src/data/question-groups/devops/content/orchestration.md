Orchestration in DevOps refers to the automated coordination and management of complex IT systems. It involves combining multiple automated tasks and processes into a single workflow to achieve a specific goal.

Nowadays, automation (or orchestration) is one of the key components of any software development process and it should never be avoided nor preferred over manual configuration.

As an automation practice, orchestration helps to remove the chance of human error from the different steps of the software development lifecycle. This is all to ensure efficient resource utilization and consistency.

Some examples of orchestration can include orchestrating container deployments with Kubernetes and automating infrastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform.
