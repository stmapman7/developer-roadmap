There are too many out there to name them all, but we can group them into two main categories: on-prem and cloud-based.

**On-prem CI/CD tools**

These tools allow you to install them on your own infrastructure and donâ€™t require any extra external internet access. Some examples are:

- Jenkins
- GitLab CI/CD (can be self-hosted)
- Bamboo
- TeamCity

**Cloud-based CI/CD tools**

On the other hand, these tools either require you to use them from the cloud or are only accessible in SaaS format, which means they provide the infrastructure, and you just use their services.

Some examples of these tools are:

- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- GitLab CI/CD (cloud version)
- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket Pipelines
