As usual, there are many options when it comes to monitoring and logging solutions, even in the space of Kubernetes. Some useful options could be a Prometheus and Grafana combo, where you get the monitoring data with the first one and plot the results however you want with the second one.

You could also set up an EFK-based (using Elastic, Fluentd, and Kibana) or ELK-based (Elastic, Logstash, and Kibana) logging solution to gather and analyze logs.

Finally, when it comes to alerting based on your monitoring data, you could use something like [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) that integrates directly with Prometheus and get notified of any issues in your infrastructure.

There are other options out there as well, such as NewRelic or Datadog. In the end, itâ€™s all about your specific needs and the context around them.
