SQL is divided into several functional subsets:

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to define or modify database structure. This includes commands like  `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`. For example, the `ALTER` table statement can be used to add, rename, and remove columns in a table.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used to insert, update, delete, or retrieve data. This includes commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. For example, the `UPDATE` statement can be used to change a user's email based on their ID
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Manages access to data by granting or revoking permissions. This includes commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`. For example, the `GRANT` statement can be used to give a user permission to select data from a table.

The major difference between these subsets lies in their purpose:

- **DDL** affects the structure of the database.
- **DML** interacts with the data itself.
- **DCL** governs who can do what within the database system.
