SQL dialects are different implementations of SQL provided by various database systems. They all follow the SQL standard used for working with data stored in multiple tables, but may include extra features or slightly different syntax.

Some common SQL dialects are:

- **MySQL**: Popular for web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its advanced features and standards compliance.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Common in enterprise environments.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight and used in mobile or embedded applications.

While the core syntax is similar, features like aggregate and scalar functions, JSON handling, or full-text search may vary slightly.

After answering the question, feel free to ask which dialect the company uses; it's a great way to learn more about their stack and how they work.
