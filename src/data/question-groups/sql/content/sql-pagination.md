When you're dealing with lots of data, it's not practical to load everything at once. Pagination helps you break results into smaller chunks.

**Option 1:** Simple offset-based pagination

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;  -- Get records 21-30
```

**Option 2:** Keyset pagination (more efficient for big data)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE (price, id) > (100.00, 12345)  -- Based on last record from previous page
ORDER BY price ASC, id ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

Offset-based pagination is easy to use, but it gets slower as the offset increases. Keyset pagination is better for deep scrolling or infinite lists.
