## Next steps

When it comes to interviews, practice really matters and the learning process doesn’t stop. Spending just 30 minutes a day on SQL can make a big difference as your interview gets closer.

Try mixing things up. Use SQL interview flashcards to quiz yourself and explore the  [SQL roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/sql) to go deeper into key concepts.

It might be tempting to focus only on SQL interview questions and quizzes, but don’t skip the hands-on part. Writing real queries helps you build context for technical and behavioral conversations, especially when the discussion touches on architecture or scale.
