Fairness means your model makes decisions that don't unfairly favor or penalize any group. Bias can sneak in at any stage, like data collection, labeling, training, and even deployment, so it needs to be addressed early and often.

**How to ensure fairness:**

- **Start with diverse training data:** Your data should reflect all the groups your model impacts. If it's skewed, the model will be too.
- **Preprocess to balance representation:** Use techniques like oversampling underrepresented groups or reweighting the data.
- **Use bias detection tools:** Libraries like Fairlearn, AIF360, and What-If Tool can help you spot performance gaps across subgroups.
- **Apply fairness constraints during training:** Use regularization, adversarial debiasing, or post-processing adjustments to reduce harm to specific groups.
- **Build transparency into the model:** Use interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, linear models) or explanation tools like SHAP and LIME.
- **Audit regularly across subgroups:** Don't rely only on overall accuracyâ€”look at performance across gender, race, age, etc.
- **Bring in human oversight:** Humans should always be part of the loop, especially in high-stakes decisions (e.g., lending, hiring).
