**Deep learning** uses multi-layered neural networks to handle complex tasks like image recognition, NLP, and recommendation systems. Think CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.

**Pros:**

- Handles complex, high-dimensional data (images, audio, text)
- Works with both structured and unstructured data
- Learns non-linear relationships
- Scales well across use cases with techniques like transfer learning
- Great at generalizing from large datasets

**Cons:**

- Requires lots of data and compute
- Heavily dependent on data quality
- Hard to interpret (black box)
- Comes with privacy and security concerns

Traditional ML uses simpler, more interpretable algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines.

**Pros:**

- Works well with smaller datasets
- Faster to train and more straightforward to interpret
- Lower computational cost
- More transparent and explainable

**Cons:**

- Struggles with complex/non-linear data
- Needs manual feature engineering
- Doesn't scale well with large datasets
- Can overfit if not tuned properly
