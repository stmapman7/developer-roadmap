A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used mainly for classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that separates data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between the closest points of each class.

Support vectors are the most important data points, useful in defining the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.
