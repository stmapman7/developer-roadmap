Variance in data science measures the spread between numbers in a dataset. Simply put, it measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average). It helps us understand how spread out or consistent the values are in a dataset.

**Low variance example:**
Mean: (78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82) / 5 = 80
