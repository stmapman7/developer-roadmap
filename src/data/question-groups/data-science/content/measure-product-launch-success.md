First, define success for that specific launch. Is it getting 1,000 new users in 30 days? Hitting a revenue or CTR goal? Building awareness in a new market? Or collecting feedback for future improvements?

Once that's clear, measure success using a mix of quantitative and qualitative KPIs across teams like marketing, product, and customer success. Some metrics I'll look at:

- **Launch campaign metrics:** To gauge marketing performance, look at leads generated, channel performance (email, ads, social), website traffic, and press coverage.
- **Product adoption metrics:** After launch, track trials, usage, activation, and user retention. These show how well the product is landing with your target audience.
- **Market impact metrics:** Measure business impact through revenue, market share, and win rates against competitors.
- **Qualitative feedback:** Talk to sales reps, product teams, and customers. Internal and external feedback helps you understand the "why" behind the numbers. Blending data with direct feedback gives you a more transparent, more nuanced view of what's working and what to improve.

**Common pitfall:** Focusing only on quantitative metrics without applying nuance to them. An example is tracking metrics like downloads without tracking engagement. Or tracking views without knowing who is viewing them.
