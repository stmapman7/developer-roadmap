The null hypothesis (Hâ‚€) is the starting point and default assumption of every statistical analysis. The idea is that there's nothing happening in your data: no stories, no effect, no relationship between the variables you're testing until your data gives strong evidence to reject it.

To know whether to reject the null hypothesis, here's what I do:

First, I set a significance level, usually 0.05. Then, I calculate the p-value. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, I reject the null hypothesis because the result is statistically significant. If it's more than 0.05, I don't reject it because there isn't enough evidence.
