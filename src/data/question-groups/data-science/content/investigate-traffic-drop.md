To analyze a sudden drop in website traffic, I would follow these steps:

- **Determine if it's a drop or a trend:** The first thing to do is try to understand whether your traffic has been declining for a while or if it has suddenly dropped for a day or two.  
- **Rule out any manual actions:** Sometimes, traffic drops happen because of a Google penalty. Check to see if there are any recent changes that you might have fallen foul of. Also, make sure that updates you made to your website's content didn't cause a problem. 
- **Check for algorithm updates:** Google frequently updates its ranking algorithm. When your site's performance drops suddenly, it's worth investigating whether an update might be responsible.
- **Investigate technical issues:** Some of the most common technical issues are indexing errors, site speed, performance, and mobile usability.
- **Check competitor activity:** Sometimes, traffic dips occur because competitors have stepped up their game. SEO tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz help track your competitors' backlinks, keywords, and rankings. Check to see whether your competitors have started outranking you for previously held keywords or launched new content targeting your primary audience.
