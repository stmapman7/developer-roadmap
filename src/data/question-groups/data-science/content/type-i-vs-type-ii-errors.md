The difference between Type I and Type II error is that Type I error rejects a true null hypothesis (a false positive), while Type II error fails to reject a false null hypothesis (a false negative).

Let's assume you're testing a new drug. The null hypothesis is that the drug doesn't work, and in reality, it indeed doesn't. A type I error occurs when your test says it does, but it doesn't; this is a false positive. A type II, on the other hand, is when the drug works in reality, but your tests say it doesn't: a false negative.
