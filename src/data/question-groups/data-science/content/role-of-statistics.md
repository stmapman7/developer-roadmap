The role of statistics in data science is to help data scientists understand and summarize data, uncover patterns, validate models, handle uncertainty (like missing or noisy data), and make evidence-based decisions.

**For example**:

- Mean and median summarize central tendencies.
- Standard deviation and variance measure variability.
- Hypothesis testing validates assumptions.
- Regression analysis predicts relationships between variables.
- Bayesian inference updates beliefs as new data comes in.

**Use case**: A marketing team runs an A/B test to compare two email campaigns. Statistical methods help determine whether the difference in click-through rates is real or just a coincidence.
