A p-value is a statistical measure that determines the significance of the result you got in a hypothesis test. A small p-value (<0.05) indicates strong evidence that the null hypothesis is wrong, meaning you should reject it.

If the probability of the p-value is greater than 0.05, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For example, if you conduct an experiment and the p-value is 0.03, you should reject the null hypothesis.
