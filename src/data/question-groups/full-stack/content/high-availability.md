**High Availability**:
* Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers
* Set up redundancy with failover systems and multiple availability zones
* Use managed databases with replicas for disaster recovery

**Scalability**:
* Implement horizontal scaling by adding more instances
* Use auto-scaling services like AWS Auto Scaling or Kubernetes
* Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., using Redis or Memcached)

**Other Best Practices**:
* Optimize database queries and use indexing
* Implement rate limiting and throttling to handle surges
