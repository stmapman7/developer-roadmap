Rather than overlapping each other, authorization and authentication reference two very distinct stages of security within your app. 

##### Authentication

On one side, we have authentication, in charge of verifying the user identity. You can use tokens (e.g., JWT, OAuth) or sessions for this.

Example: Validate a JWT sent in headers:  

```javascript
const token = req.headers['authorization'];
jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => { ... });
```

##### Authorization

Once authenticated, users need to be authorized to access the resources. For this to work, youâ€™ll need to define roles  and permissions for your users.

Middleware example:  

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  next();
});
```

##### Best Practices

* Use HTTPS to ensure a secure channel between the browser and the server.  
* Validate input to prevent injection attacks.  
* Rate-limit API requests to avoid having your APIs overwhelmed by potential attackers.  
* Store sensitive data securely (e.g., hashed passwords).
