The performance of a React application can be affected by multiple aspects, but some of the most common ones and their way to fix them are:

1. **Reduce Re-renders**:  
   * Use `React.memo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary updates.  
   * Split large components into smaller, focused components.  
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load components or routes on demand using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.  
3. **Efficient State Management**: Keep state local where possible and avoid overusing global state.  
4. **Minimize DOM Updates**: Use keys in lists and avoid deeply nested props/state updates.  
5. **Code Splitting**: Use Webpack or tools like `react-loadable` to split the bundle.  
6. **Profile and Debug**: Use React Developer Tools to identify bottlenecks.
