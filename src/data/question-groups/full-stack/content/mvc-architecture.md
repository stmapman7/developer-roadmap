**MVC** is a design pattern for organizing code in three layers:

1. **Model**: Handles data and business logic (e.g., database interactions).  
2. **View**: Displays data to users (e.g., HTML, templates).  
3. **Controller**: Manages user input and communicates between Model and View.

**Flow**:
* User interacts with the **View** → **Controller** processes input → Updates the **Model** → Changes are reflected in the **View**.
