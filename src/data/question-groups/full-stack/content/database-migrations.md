1. **Version Control**: Track migrations using tools like Flyway, Liquibase, or Sequelize.

2. **Create Safe Migration Scripts**:  
   * Avoid destructive changes like dropping columns immediately
   * Break migrations into additive steps:
     - Add new columns
     - Backfill data
     - Remove old columns later

3. **Testing**:  
   * Test migrations in a staging environment with a copy of production data

4. **Rollback Plans**:  
   * Write scripts to revert migrations in case of failure

5. **Zero-Downtime Deployment**:  
   * Use techniques like dual writes and feature flags to ensure smooth transitions
