As a full-stack developer, the monitoring of your application involves the full 360 view of the app, from the frontend into the backend, including the database, and other involved systems.

##### Frontend Monitoring:
* Use tools like Google Lighthouse or Web Vitals to track load times, interactivity, and rendering.
* Monitor user behavior with tools like New Relic Browser or LogRocket.

##### Backend Monitoring:
* Use APM tools (e.g., Datadog, Dynatrace) to monitor server response times, database query performance, and API latency.

##### Logging:
* Centralize logs with tools like ELK Stack or CloudWatch Logs for analyzing bottlenecks.
* Critical for systems with many individual microservices and different clients working together.

##### Database Monitoring:
* Use query profilers (e.g., MySQL EXPLAIN) and monitor database health with tools like Percona Monitoring.

##### Alerting:
* Set up alerts for anomalies or thresholds using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
