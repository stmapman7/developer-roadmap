**WebSockets**: A protocol for full-duplex communication between client and server over a single persistent connection.

**Difference**:

* **HTTP**: Request-response model; client initiates every interaction.  
* **WebSockets**: Persistent, allowing real-time, two-way communication (e.g., live chat, notifications).

Example:

* HTTP: Send a request for new messages repeatedly (polling).  
* WebSocket: Server pushes new messages as they arrive.
