React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

With hooks you can simplify state and lifecycle management without needing class components. They also enable code reuse through custom hooks.

**Examples of different hooks**:

* `useState` for managing state.  
* `useEffect` for handling side effects (e.g., fetching data).  
* `useContext` for global state.
