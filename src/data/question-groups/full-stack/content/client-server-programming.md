The **client-side** and **server-side** refer to two distinct parts of a **web application** that work together to deliver functionality to users. Understanding their roles is essential for building efficient and responsive applications.

##### Client-Side
* **What it Does**: This is the part of the application that runs in the userâ€™s browser. It handles **user interfaces** and interactions, allowing users to see and interact with the application.  
* **Key Characteristics**:  
  * Executes **JavaScript code** directly in the browser to handle tasks like form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates (through DOM \-Document Object Model- updates).  
  * Manages rendering of HTML and CSS for a seamless visual experience.  
  * Often communicates with the server via **REST (Representational State Transfer)** APIs to fetch or send data asynchronously.  
* **Examples**:  
  * Clicking a button that triggers a JavaScript function to show a popup.  
  * Fetching additional items on a page using `fetch()` or `axios` without a full page reload.  

##### Server-Side

* **What it Does**: This part operates on the server and processes requests from the client, performing tasks like database queries, business logic, and serving responses.  
* **Key Characteristics**:  
  * Executes server-side programming languages like Python, Java, or Node.js.  
  * Handles sensitive operations like authentication and data storage securely.  
  * Sends data to the client in structured formats (e.g., JSON) via **REST APIs** for rendering.  
* **Examples**:  
  * Processing a login request by verifying credentials in a database.  
  * Returning a list of products in JSON format for the client to display dynamically.
