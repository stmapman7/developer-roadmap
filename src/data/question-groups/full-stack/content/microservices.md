1. **Decompose the Application**: Identify distinct business domains and split functionality into small, loosely coupled services.

2. **Service Communication**: 
   * Use APIs (REST or GraphQL) for synchronous communication
   * Use messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication

3. **Independent Data Stores**: Each service manages its own database to ensure independence.

4. **Service Discovery**: Use a registry like Consul or Eureka to manage service locations dynamically.

5. **Deployment**: 
   * Containerize services with Docker
   * Orchestrate using Kubernetes

6. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack for observability and debugging.
