1. **Challenge**: Managing State Across Frontend and Backend.  
   * **Solution**: Use global state management tools (e.g., Redux, Zustand) and APIs with clear data contracts.  

2. **Challenge**: Scalability Issues.  
   * **Solution**: Optimize database queries, implement caching, and use scalable cloud infrastructure.  

3. **Challenge**: Security Concerns.  
   * **Solution**: Implement secure authentication (e.g., OAuth2), sanitize inputs, and follow OWASP guidelines.  

4. **Challenge**: Maintain a consistent quality level across the entire codebase (both frontend and backend code).  
   * **Solution**: Implement a robust testing strategy that includes: unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and regular code reviews.  

5. **Challenge**: Keeping Up with Technology Updates.  
   * **Solution**: Adopt modular architecture to replace outdated tech incrementally.  

6. **Challenge**: Debugging Complex Interactions Between Frontend and Backend.  
   * **Solution**: Use end-to-end testing frameworks (e.g., Cypress) and logging tools for tracing issues.
