**Purpose**: Version control tracks changes in code, enables collaboration, and allows reverting to previous versions.

**Git Workflow Example**:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`.  
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`.  
3. Make changes and stage them: `git add .`.  
4. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add feature"`.  
5. Push to the remote: `git push origin feature-branch`.  
6. Create a pull request for review.  
7. Merge the branch into the main branch after approval.
