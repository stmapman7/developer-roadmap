**Full-stack development** refers to the practice of building and maintaining both the **frontend** and **backend** of a **web application** or **web service**. A full-stack developer works across all layers of the application, ensuring seamless functionality from the user interface to the server and database.

Key aspects of full-stack development include:

* **Frontend Development**: Involves creating the parts of the application that users interact with directly, such as buttons, forms, and layouts. Tools and technologies often used include **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. This may also include building **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** for enhanced user experiences.  
* **Backend Development**: Focuses on server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the frontend. Common programming languages for backend development include **Python**, **Java**, **Node.js**, and **PHP**. Developers often design and integrate **web services** or REST/GraphQL APIs for data handling.  
* **Databases and Storage**: Managing data through relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).  
* **DevOps and Deployment**: Setting up hosting environments, CI/CD pipelines, and handling cloud services to deploy and maintain applications.

Full-stack developers are valued for their versatility and ability to understand how different components of a web application interact, making them crucial for delivering well-rounded, functional products.
