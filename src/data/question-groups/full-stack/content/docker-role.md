Docker containerizes applications and their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across environments.

**In Development**:  
* Provides isolated environments (e.g., for different projects).  
* Simplifies onboarding (e.g., no need to manually install dependencies).  

**In Deployment**:  
* Ensures consistent environments between dev and production.  
* Integrates with orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalability.

Example Dockerfile:  
```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
