1. **In-Memory Cache**: Use tools like Redis or Memcached for quick access to frequently used data. Common use case is caching results of expensive database queries.

2. **HTTP Caching**: Leverage `Cache-Control` headers for client-side and proxy caching.

3. **Application-Level Caching**: Store calculated values or frequently used objects in memory using libraries like `express-cache` or decorators.

4. **Distributed Caching**: In distributed systems, use a shared cache (e.g., Redis) to ensure consistency across instances.

5. **Cache Invalidation**: Use strategies like time-to-live (TTL) or event-driven invalidation to keep the cache up-to-date.

6. **Testing**: Monitor cache hit rates and ensure no stale data is served.

**Browser Caching**: While not strictly server-side, take advantage of browser caching to store static resources client-side, reducing backend requests.
