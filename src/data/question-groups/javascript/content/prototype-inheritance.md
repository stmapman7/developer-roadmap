Prototype inheritance is when objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each item has a "prototype," i.e., the parent object. Whenever you want to use a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if it has it. If not, it looks at the object's prototype to see if it has it. If the prototype has it, then the object "inherits" it. This process continues until it finds the property it's looking for or hits the end of the prototype chain.

For example, Date objects, like timestamps, inherit their properties and methods from the Date prototype. Math objects provide existing tools and features for math tasks, but do not rely on or inherit from a Math prototype. Array objects, like lists, get their features and actions from the Array prototype.
