The "this" keyword in JavaScript refers to the object or context on which a code runs. Examples of these codes include function calls, object methods, event handlers, and more. You use it to access the properties and methods of that object. The value of this keyword changes depending on how you use (or call) the function.

When you use "this" in the context of a method, "this" indicates the object that owns the method. For standalone functions, "this" is the global object, but in strict mode it's undefined. Also, in event handlers, "this" refers to the element that caused the event.
