Primitive and non-primitive data types are the two main data types in JavaScript. Primitive data types are the main elements that make up all the data you work with in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning you can't change their values once you create them. Also, they're stored in memory as single values. Some examples of primitive data types include:

- Number (numeric values, e.g., 78).
- String (text values, e.g., "hey").
- Boolean values (true or false).
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbols

Non-primitive data types, also called reference data types, store groups of data or complex structures. They are mutable, meaning you can change their values once you create them. Unlike primitive data types, they're stored in memory as references rather than single values. Some examples of non-primitive data types include:

- Object (collection of key-value pairs, e.g., { name: 'cess', age: 26 };).
- Array (e.g., [10, 12, 13]).
- Function (e.g., function add(a = 10, b = 5) { return a + b; }).
