A syntax error happens when you write code that the JavaScript engine can't understand, so your code won't run. It can be when you make a typo spelling a keyword or forget to close a bracket, parenthesis, or curly brace.

```javascript
console.log("JavaScript interview questions"
```

A reference error occurs when you try to use a variable or a function that doesn't exist. The code will run, but it won't find what you're referencing since you didn't create the variable using let, var, and const keywords.

```javascript
console.log(myStudy);
```
