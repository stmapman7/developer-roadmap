The following are the naming conventions for variables in JavaScript:

- Write variable names in camelCase. Use lowercase letters to begin the variable name and then uppercase for each new word, e.g., myName.
- Use descriptive variable names. Instead of using "p" as a variable name for a password, use userPassword instead.
- Don't use JavaScript keywords such as if, for, or while as variable names.
- Don't include special characters like punctuation and math operators in your variable names. Only use underscores (_) and dollar signs ($).
- Don't start variable names with numbers; instead, place them at the end. For example, you can't have 99myName, but myName99 is okay.
