Global scope is all the variables you can access from anywhere in your JavaScript code. When you declare a variable outside of any function or block, it becomes a global variable. Using too many global variables can make your code difficult to read.

In contrast, local scope is a variable you can only access within a function. When you declare a variable inside any function or block of code, it becomes a local ****variable. It helps to organize your JavaScript code, making it easier to read. When coding in JavaScript, try to use local scope variables instead of global scope variables as much as possible.
