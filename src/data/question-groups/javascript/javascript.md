![JavaScript interview questions](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-itam7.jpg)

JavaScript interviews can be rough, even for developers with years of experience. You're expected to understand the language's basics and more complex parts. Interviewers want to see how well you know the language and how you use it to solve problems. It's a good idea to brush up on some common JavaScript interview questions before your interview.

When preparing for a JavaScript interview, make sure you don't just memorize everything. Instead, focus on developing a good understanding of the language and getting to know it inside and out. Start by learning the basics, e.g., variables, and then you can move on to more advanced topics like async/await. Doing this will help you analyze things better and use your knowledge in building web apps.

In this guide, I'll cover top JavaScript interview questions and answers to help you prepare well. I'll cover basic syntax, data types, and advanced concepts like async/await. You'll also find a collection of flashcards designed to help you practice and learn better. But if you want to research more on each topic or start learning about JavaScript, check out the [JavaScript roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/javascript).

## Preparing for your JavaScript interview

Prepare for your JavaScript interview by keeping these tips in mind:

- Improve your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts by learning variables, arrays, and more.
- Practice building projects using sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).**
- Learn how to use advanced JavaScript topics such as async/await to create apps that fix everyday issues people deal with.
- If you need to, learn JavaScript frameworks and libraries like [React](https://roadmap.sh/react) and [Angular](https://roadmap.sh/angular) for the job. Know how components and state management work in your chosen framework or library.
- Use this guide to understand common JavaScript interview questions. Practice answering them, and be ready to explain how you came up with your answers. Try practicing with a friend to get some feedback to help you improve.
- Learn about the company and what they're all about. It'll help you better understand what they want and how to answer the interview questions.
