Indexes in databases are like the indexes in books. They increase the speed of data retrieval from a database. When you want to read data from a table, instead of going through all the rows of the table, indexes help to go straight to the row you are looking for.

They improve **SELECT** queries, improve performance, and make sorting and filtering faster. They also ensure data integrity. There are different types of indexes, which include:

- B-Tree index
- Composite index
- Unique index
- Full text index
- Bitmap index
- Clustered index
- Non-clustered index
