**EXISTS** and **IN** are used in subqueries to filter results, but they perform different functions depending on their usage. 

You should use **EXISTS** in the following situations:

- When you want to check if a row exists and not the actual values.
- When the subquery is a correlated query.
- When the subquery returns many rows but you want to get the first match.

You should use **IN** in the following scenarios:

- When you are comparing a column to a list of values.
- When the subquery returns a small or static list.
