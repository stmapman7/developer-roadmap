Data mining is the practice of analyzing large datasets to discover hidden patterns, relationships, or insights using methods from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. 

While data mining might sound a lot like Exploratory Analysis (or EDA) because they both involve exploring data, they differ in scope and depth. EDA focuses on summarizing and visualizing the dataset to understand its structure and quality, typically as a precursor to modeling. 

Data mining, on the other hand, involves applying more advanced, often automated techniques to uncover non-obvious patterns, often with the goal of prediction or segmentation.
