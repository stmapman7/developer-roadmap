Excel is probably one of the most versatile tools for quick data exploration, initial data cleaning, pivoting, and aggregating data points, as long as the volume of data is manageable by the program. 

It is often used in combination with SQL for querying structured data, and Python or R for more advanced analysis options. 

You can think of Excel as a flexible interface for rapid prototyping before scaling workflows.
