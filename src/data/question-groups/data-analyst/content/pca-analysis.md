Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analytics to simplify large data sets by transforming correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated components. 

In simpler terms, imagine having a spreadsheet with dozens of similar columns about customers' habits. In this case, PCA helps condense that data into a few powerful new columns that still capture most of the important patterns, making the data easier to analyze without losing much meaning.

Data analysts often use PCA in scenarios where datasets have many features, such as customer behavior tracking, to reduce noise and improve the performance of clustering or classification algorithms.
