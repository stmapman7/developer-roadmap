Advanced profiling methods include statistical summaries (e.g., mean, standard deviation), z-score or IQR-based outlier detection, and fuzzy matching for duplicates. 

For continuous probability distributions, verifying normality ensures that imputation and anomaly detection methods are applied appropriately, maintaining data quality and analytical accuracy.
