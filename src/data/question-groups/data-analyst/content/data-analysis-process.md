It's usually a good idea to follow a five-step process when working with raw data:

1. **Understand the problem**: Begin by clearly defining the problem to solve, identifying the business objective, and determining what kind of insight is required to obtain (this is the end goal after all).  
2. **Collect the data**: Once the objective is clear, gather the data. This data can come from databases, APIs, spreadsheets, or even third-party sources.  
3. **Clean and organize the data**: We'll want to clean the data by removing duplicates, handling absent values, and standardizing formats.  
4. **Explore the data through visualizations**: With the clean data, start playing around with different visualizations to explore trends, distributions, and relationships.   
5. **Draw conclusions based on findings**: Finally, analyze the data in the context of the original problem and use the results to draw insights.
