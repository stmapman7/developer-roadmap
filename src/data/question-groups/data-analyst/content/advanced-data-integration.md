An advanced data analysis project might involve integrating unprocessed data from internal CRM systems, web analytics platforms, and third-party APIs. 

The process can include standardizing schemas, mapping identifiers, and applying robust profiling techniques to detect incorrect values and missing entries. 

Wrangling tools such as Python and SQL are also used alongside validation rules to maintain consistent quality, resulting in accurate, actionable insights that support stakeholder decision-making.
