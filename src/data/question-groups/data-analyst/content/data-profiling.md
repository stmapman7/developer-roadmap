Profiling is the process of examining the data available in an existing dataset and collecting statistics and summaries about that data. While it might be confused with EDA, profiling can instead be considered as the first step of EDA, helping to identify quality issues such as null values, duplicate records, outliers, and unexpected formats. Thus allowing analysts to correct or address these problems before they start looking for patterns and outliers as part of the exploratory analysis.
