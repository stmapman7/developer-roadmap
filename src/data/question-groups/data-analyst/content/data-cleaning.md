Cleaning data and handling the lack of some values typically involves several steps:

1. **Identify missing or inconsistent data**: We first have to scan the dataset for null values, anomalies, or formatting issues that could be caused by errors.  
2. **Assess the impact of missing values**: We then evaluate how much data is missing and determine how critical those fields are to the analysis.   
3. **Select a handling strategy**: Next, we choose whether to fill in missing data (imputation), exclude affected rows, or flag incomplete records. It all depends on the business context, of course.  
4. **Impute or remove values**: If you're going to impute data, use methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation, to calculate the missing values in a way that makes sense to the context of the data. Otherwise, just remove records with excessive gaps if necessary.  
5. **Verify the cleaned dataset**: Run data validation checks to ensure that the cleaning process preserved data integrity and did not introduce bias.
