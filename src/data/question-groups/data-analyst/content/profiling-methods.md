Data profiling involves assessing the structure, content, and quality of a dataset. In other words, getting a quick picture of what the data looks like without going through the entire data set.

The most common methods include checking for missing values, detecting incorrect values, reviewing data types and ranges, and identifying duplicate data. 

Automated profiling tools and custom scripts help data analysts uncover issues before performing deeper analysis.
