Data visualization transforms complex data sets into intuitive visuals that highlight trends, outliers, and relationships. Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Microsoft Excel enable data analysts to build dashboards and reports that help stakeholders make informed decisions. 

Effective visualizations improve communication and accelerate decision-making based on real-time data insights. 

In simpler terms, good charts and dashboards help people quickly understand what's going on in the business. What's working, what's not, and where they should focus next, without needing to dig through rows of data themselves.
