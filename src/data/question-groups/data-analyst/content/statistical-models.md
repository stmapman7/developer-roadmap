There are dozens of commonly used statistical models, and data analysts use several of them with other techniques depending on the analysis objective. 

Common methods include linear and logistic regression, hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests), ANOVA, time series analysis, and Bayesian inference. These tools help analyze data, identify trends, and validate assumptions during the data analysis process.
