Univariate analysis involves examining a single variable to understand its distribution, central tendency, or spread. 

Bivariate analysis, then, involves exploring the relationship between two variables, such as using scatter plots or correlation analysis. 

Finally, multivariate analysis expands this further to three or more variables, allowing analysts to investigate how several variables interact and influence each other.
