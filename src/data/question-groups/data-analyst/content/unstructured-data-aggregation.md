When working with data that is not structured such as customer reviews, social media comments, or even video feed data, the key is to turn it into structured data. The way to do that depends on the source and type of the data, for instance, text information (such as reviews, or social media comments) can be processed with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract structured elements like sentiment or keyword frequency. 

After that, data aggregation techniques, such as calculating average sentiment by product or keyword frequency counts, can then be used to uncover trends and support marketing and product strategies. 

In other words, turn the chaos of data into a structured format, and then derive insight by aggregating it.
