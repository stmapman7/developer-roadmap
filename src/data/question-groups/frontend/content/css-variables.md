Just like variables in [frontend programming languages](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/languages), CSS variables can be set by developers and reused across the entire CSS stylesheets. They’re great for centralizing global values that are used throughout the web site’s code.

They’re also heavily used by CSS frameworks to set constants such as the value of colors (i.e. “black” being “#222” instead of “000”.)
