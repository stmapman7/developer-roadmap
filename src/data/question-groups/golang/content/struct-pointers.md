A pointer to an existing struct in Go holds the address of the struct, so modifying the struct through its pointer directly alters the original data, which can be efficient for large structs (because you can pass it around into functions without copying all of its content) but requires careful management to avoid unintended side effects (like with any other pointer-based operation).
