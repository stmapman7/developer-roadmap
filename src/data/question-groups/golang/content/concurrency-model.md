Go's concurrency model is different from traditional alternatives because it uses goroutines instead of OS threads. These goroutines, which are non-native threads managed by the runtime require a fraction of the memory OS threads normally require. 

On top of that, these goroutines communicate with each other through "channels", ensuring that data flows safely from one function to another. 

This design improves cpu and memory resources management, making concurrent programming in the Go efficient and robust.
