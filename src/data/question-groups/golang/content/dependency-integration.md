Go integrates version control with its module system, using go.mod and go.sum files to track versions and package references. This setup ensures that builds are reproducibleâ€”everyone using the same go.mod file gets identical versions, while go.sum verifies the integrity of downloaded modules with cryptographic hashes.

Best practices include adhering to semantic versioning, regularly updating dependencies (while checking backwards compatibility), and maintaining reproducible builds through version control integration.
