Even with Go's efficient and automatic memory management in place things can still go wrong, and leaks can occur if developers are not careful with the resources they create. 

To help you find and solve those memory issues, profiling tools and the runtime can help identify bottlenecks in memory usage. 

Some strategies to help you either avoid or deal with memory issues include careful variable declaration, proper cleanup to ensure, and monitoring garbage collection. In other words, be careful how you instantiate and use your resources, and use the proper tools to understand when there are problems.
