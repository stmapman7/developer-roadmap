In Go, the allocation of memory is managed by the runtime, which decides whether to allocate on the stack or heap based on variable declaration; this is defined during the phase known as "escape analysis".

The garbage collector then periodically reclaims memory, preventing leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage.
