In Go you can use lightweight threads to manage concurrent tasks. These lightweight alternatives use much less memory and resources than their native counterparts. And they can use "channels" to share data between them.

These "goroutines" are incredibly efficient, managed by Go's runtime, and provide developers with a much needed simplified threading model.
