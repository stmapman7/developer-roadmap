Value types, such as integers and structs, are copied when passed to functions. In contrast, reference types, including slices and maps, hold an address pointing to the original data (they're in fact, pointers) in memory. 

This difference affects how data transfer happens and the logic behind how memory gets allocated, making it essential to understand when designing reusable code.
