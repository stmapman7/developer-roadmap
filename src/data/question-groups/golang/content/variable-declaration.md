Declaring variables in Go is very straightforward. You can use the var keyword or shorthand declaration inside a function. 

Regarding the "zero value" concept, uninitialized variables are automatically assigned what is known as a zero value, meaning they get assigned the value 0 or its equivalent for the corresponding type of the variable. For example, while a numeric variable might get a 0, a boolean one would get a "false" as a default value.

This feature simplifies coding and avoids unexpected behavior during data transfer between other functions.
