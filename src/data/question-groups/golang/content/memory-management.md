Go's management of the memory space is handled automatically through garbage collection. 

This process frees up memory that is no longer needed, preventing leaks. Given its automatic nature, the operation is overseen by Go's runtime, ensuring that cpu and memory remain optimized, which is a major advantage compared to the manual alternative that other languages like C or C++ have.
