Go's basic data types include booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. These basic data types in Go are similar to those in other languages; however, Go enforces that all variables share types during operations, in other words, Go is strongly typed. 

This need for explicit type conversion (there is no implicit alternative in Go) requirement minimizes runtime errors and increases code reliability.
